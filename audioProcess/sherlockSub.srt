00:00:03,899 --> 00:00:06,359
Mysteries and Other Stories by John

00:00:06,359 --> 00:00:10,940
Taylor read by Benedict Cumberbatch

[Music]

5
00:00:17,580 --> 00:00:21,619
an inscrutable masquerade

6
00:00:21,940 --> 00:00:24,840
[Music]

7
00:00:24,840 --> 00:00:27,359
in a draw in the Bureau of an upstairs

8
00:00:27,359 --> 00:00:30,359
room of my current home there is a

9
00:00:30,359 --> 00:00:33,180
locked cedar wood box which I inherited

10
00:00:33,180 --> 00:00:35,640
as a youth from my grandfather

11
00:00:35,640 --> 00:00:40,140
this is one might say my box of Secrets

12
00:00:40,140 --> 00:00:41,879
when I was young it contained the

13
00:00:41,879 --> 00:00:44,280
treasures of Boyhood a catapult a lump

14
00:00:44,280 --> 00:00:47,219
of beeswax the carapace of a crab

15
00:00:47,219 --> 00:00:49,379
for many years since it has been the

16
00:00:49,379 --> 00:00:52,320
repository of an archive admittedly a

17
00:00:52,320 --> 00:00:55,199
ragged and disordered archive a

18
00:00:55,199 --> 00:00:56,699
collection of notes and scribblings

19
00:00:56,699 --> 00:00:59,039
concerning some of the many cases of my

20
00:00:59,039 --> 00:01:02,239
lifelong friend the Consulting detective

21
00:01:02,239 --> 00:01:05,519
Sherlock Holmes which for one reason or

22
00:01:05,519 --> 00:01:07,560
another I never took the travel to write

23
00:01:07,560 --> 00:01:09,240
into proper reports

24
00:01:09,240 --> 00:01:11,939
having had recently a little time on my

25
00:01:11,939 --> 00:01:14,280
hands I reopened this box of yellowing

26
00:01:14,280 --> 00:01:15,780
notebooks and it seemed to me that

27
00:01:15,780 --> 00:01:17,760
several of the cases given the ocean of

28
00:01:17,760 --> 00:01:19,740
time between those events and the

29
00:01:19,740 --> 00:01:23,159
present day would now bear telling

30
00:01:23,159 --> 00:01:25,920
and I begin by chronicling an adventure

31
00:01:25,920 --> 00:01:27,659
which I may have dismissed for several

32
00:01:27,659 --> 00:01:29,759
reasons not because it lacked baffling

33
00:01:29,759 --> 00:01:31,920
and intriguing elements on the contrary

34
00:01:31,920 --> 00:01:34,799
but mostly I think because it was for me

35
00:01:34,799 --> 00:01:37,380
personally such a dizzying and

36
00:01:37,380 --> 00:01:40,020
distressing experience

37
00:01:40,020 --> 00:01:42,479
it was a Wednesday evening in July at

38
00:01:42,479 --> 00:01:44,460
the end of a day of Street jacketing

39
00:01:44,460 --> 00:01:45,299
Heat

40
00:01:45,299 --> 00:01:47,820
and I sat next to the open window of our

41
00:01:47,820 --> 00:01:50,280
parlor at Baker Street drinking in the

42
00:01:50,280 --> 00:01:52,500
air and hoping for the liberating Ripple

43
00:01:52,500 --> 00:01:53,939
of a breeze

44
00:01:53,939 --> 00:01:56,520
the newspaper on my lap reported the

45
00:01:56,520 --> 00:01:59,159
release from police custody of a known

46
00:01:59,159 --> 00:02:02,640
criminal Tobias organ arrested some days

47
00:02:02,640 --> 00:02:04,320
previously for the murder of Max

48
00:02:04,320 --> 00:02:07,140
Zimmerman a money lender shot through

49
00:02:07,140 --> 00:02:09,000
the head in his small apartment in

50
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:10,380
Wardle Street

51
00:02:10,380 --> 00:02:12,480
in the end they'd been insufficient

52
00:02:12,480 --> 00:02:14,400
evidence to charge organ with murder

53
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:16,620
even though the police clearly thought

54
00:02:16,620 --> 00:02:18,540
him culpable

55
00:02:18,540 --> 00:02:21,360
strangely enough I had once met organ

56
00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:23,879
myself he had come to me as a patient

57
00:02:23,879 --> 00:02:25,800
suffering as I recall from a severe

58
00:02:25,800 --> 00:02:27,900
lesion to the lower back which he

59
00:02:27,900 --> 00:02:29,879
maintained had been caused by a fall

60
00:02:29,879 --> 00:02:32,819
against a metal stanchion but which I

61
00:02:32,819 --> 00:02:34,739
had little doubt was in fact a stab

62
00:02:34,739 --> 00:02:37,260
wound my diagnosis was supported I

63
00:02:37,260 --> 00:02:39,360
Believe by his barely Veiled Threat that

64
00:02:39,360 --> 00:02:41,400
I should under no circumstances make

65
00:02:41,400 --> 00:02:44,040
known his injury to anyone else

66
00:02:44,040 --> 00:02:47,640
he had an unforgettable menacing way

67
00:02:47,640 --> 00:02:49,980
with him and I had felt immense relief

68
00:02:49,980 --> 00:02:52,440
when he left my surgery

69
00:02:52,440 --> 00:02:54,360
I'd been looking forward to discussing

70
00:02:54,360 --> 00:02:56,879
the organ case with Holmes who would

71
00:02:56,879 --> 00:02:59,340
certainly have some views on the subject

72
00:02:59,340 --> 00:03:00,959
but when he finally appeared for dinner

73
00:03:00,959 --> 00:03:03,540
he was irritable and uncommunicative and

74
00:03:03,540 --> 00:03:05,940
from these symptoms I guessed him to be

75
00:03:05,940 --> 00:03:07,860
in the process of some taxing mental

76
00:03:07,860 --> 00:03:08,640
work

77
00:03:08,640 --> 00:03:10,560
all the same I had no wish to sit out

78
00:03:10,560 --> 00:03:12,720
the meal in silence

79
00:03:12,720 --> 00:03:14,459
stifling weather to be out and about

80
00:03:14,459 --> 00:03:17,540
homes I said peppering a slice of beef

81
00:03:17,540 --> 00:03:20,760
indeed Watson and equally stifling to be

82
00:03:20,760 --> 00:03:21,659
in

83
00:03:21,659 --> 00:03:23,640
he visited himself with cutting into a

84
00:03:23,640 --> 00:03:24,540
potato

85
00:03:24,540 --> 00:03:26,819
after a while I said I've not seen you

86
00:03:26,819 --> 00:03:28,620
today I presume you were somewhere on

87
00:03:28,620 --> 00:03:29,760
business

88
00:03:29,760 --> 00:03:32,340
yes Watson I was

89
00:03:32,340 --> 00:03:36,000
another pause the of cutlery

90
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:38,400
somewhere local somewhere very local

91
00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:40,680
Watson I'd expect you'd like to know

92
00:03:40,680 --> 00:03:42,900
where well I I have no wish to be

93
00:03:42,900 --> 00:03:45,480
intrusive in the basement I've been all

94
00:03:45,480 --> 00:03:47,760
day in the basement of our house and

95
00:03:47,760 --> 00:03:49,500
since your desire not to be intrusive is

96
00:03:49,500 --> 00:03:50,819
clearly struggling against your

97
00:03:50,819 --> 00:03:53,280
overwhelming curiosity to know I will

98
00:03:53,280 --> 00:03:55,379
tell you why I was there

99
00:03:55,379 --> 00:03:58,500
and he paused and smiled in the full

100
00:03:58,500 --> 00:04:00,480
confidence that you will not breathe a

101
00:04:00,480 --> 00:04:02,760
word to a soul about it

102
00:04:02,760 --> 00:04:05,159
my homes of course not and on the

103
00:04:05,159 --> 00:04:06,959
understanding that if I do tell you you

104
00:04:06,959 --> 00:04:08,099
will not be able to leave this house

105
00:04:08,099 --> 00:04:10,980
until my work is complete what

106
00:04:10,980 --> 00:04:14,040
I put down almost dropped my knife and

107
00:04:14,040 --> 00:04:17,040
fork we don't mean not leave at all

108
00:04:17,040 --> 00:04:19,918
that's precisely what I mean so it may

109
00:04:19,918 --> 00:04:22,139
be that you would prefer to forego my

110
00:04:22,139 --> 00:04:24,120
secret rather than consent to becoming a

111
00:04:24,120 --> 00:04:26,100
prisoner here for what might be several

112
00:04:26,100 --> 00:04:27,660
days

113
00:04:27,660 --> 00:04:30,419
hopelessly intrigued I gave no thought

114
00:04:30,419 --> 00:04:32,340
to the discomfort of being shut indoors

115
00:04:32,340 --> 00:04:34,440
in this sultry heat no thought to the

116
00:04:34,440 --> 00:04:36,300
boredom not even any thought to the fact

117
00:04:36,300 --> 00:04:39,120
that I had appointments in my diary

118
00:04:39,120 --> 00:04:41,400
I'm prepared to abide by your request

119
00:04:41,400 --> 00:04:42,479
homes

120
00:04:42,479 --> 00:04:44,639
he stood up from the table his meal

121
00:04:44,639 --> 00:04:46,919
unfinished and went across to the Hearth

122
00:04:46,919 --> 00:04:48,720
to retrieve his pipe and tobacco pouch

123
00:04:48,720 --> 00:04:51,540
as he filled his pipe and lit it he sank

124
00:04:51,540 --> 00:04:53,220
into his armchair

125
00:04:53,220 --> 00:04:55,380
I believe you have been preoccupied with

126
00:04:55,380 --> 00:04:57,720
the case of Tobias organ Watson

127
00:04:57,720 --> 00:05:00,540
yes it has been on my mind how you twice

128
00:05:00,540 --> 00:05:03,360
left the newspaper open at that page

129
00:05:03,360 --> 00:05:05,340
the money lender Zimmerman a legitimate

130
00:05:05,340 --> 00:05:06,840
businessman with a wife and young

131
00:05:06,840 --> 00:05:09,240
children was murdered with an army rifle

132
00:05:09,240 --> 00:05:11,340
the police have many reasons for

133
00:05:11,340 --> 00:05:12,960
believing Tobias organ to be guilty of

134
00:05:12,960 --> 00:05:14,340
the crime of one of these is that he

135
00:05:14,340 --> 00:05:16,500
owns an army rifle

136
00:05:16,500 --> 00:05:18,900
organ of course denies that his firearm

137
00:05:18,900 --> 00:05:21,540
is the murder weapon well yes I said one

138
00:05:21,540 --> 00:05:24,300
would expect he would but suppose said

139
00:05:24,300 --> 00:05:27,479
Holmes Suppose there was a science which

140
00:05:27,479 --> 00:05:30,180
could with certainty tie a bullet to the

141
00:05:30,180 --> 00:05:33,180
gun which fired it now that would be

142
00:05:33,180 --> 00:05:36,000
marvelous I said but that isn't is there

143
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:38,039
well Watson let us say that such a

144
00:05:38,039 --> 00:05:40,680
science is seminal it is exactly this

145
00:05:40,680 --> 00:05:42,060
problem which I am wrestling with at

146
00:05:42,060 --> 00:05:43,979
present in the basement of the house

147
00:05:43,979 --> 00:05:46,380
I've set up a laboratory of sorts down

148
00:05:46,380 --> 00:05:47,820
there where I can conduct some

149
00:05:47,820 --> 00:05:49,860
experiments progress is promising and if

150
00:05:49,860 --> 00:05:52,139
the results are as I expect they will

151
00:05:52,139 --> 00:05:53,699
certainly send Tobias organ to The

152
00:05:53,699 --> 00:05:56,759
Gallows but organ is an utterly ruthless

153
00:05:56,759 --> 00:05:58,860
villain undoubtedly guilty of a number

154
00:05:58,860 --> 00:06:00,720
of murders but devious enough always to

155
00:06:00,720 --> 00:06:03,120
Palm them off on others if he were to

156
00:06:03,120 --> 00:06:05,880
gain even an inkling of my work we would

157
00:06:05,880 --> 00:06:08,639
be in the utmost Danger

158
00:06:08,639 --> 00:06:10,680
but I can see that you would be in

159
00:06:10,680 --> 00:06:13,740
danger homes but how might I be as I say

160
00:06:13,740 --> 00:06:16,560
Watson organ is ruthless to get at any

161
00:06:16,560 --> 00:06:18,900
enemy his favorite trick is to abduct

162
00:06:18,900 --> 00:06:21,600
someone close to his adversary often

163
00:06:21,600 --> 00:06:24,840
with I'm afraid horrific consequences

164
00:06:24,840 --> 00:06:27,240
you know too much now and since I'm not

165
00:06:27,240 --> 00:06:28,860
prepared to put you at risk in that way

166
00:06:28,860 --> 00:06:31,199
I fear you must sit it out in these

167
00:06:31,199 --> 00:06:32,940
apartments you must not answer the door

168
00:06:32,940 --> 00:06:34,560
you must stay away from the windows no

169
00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:37,139
visitors you must lead the life of a

170
00:06:37,139 --> 00:06:39,419
prisoner until such time as this matter

171
00:06:39,419 --> 00:06:40,860
is settled

172
00:06:40,860 --> 00:06:44,039
well I said it might be good for me I

173
00:06:44,039 --> 00:06:45,360
have a medical paper to write in the

174
00:06:45,360 --> 00:06:47,100
period of confinement might induce me to

175
00:06:47,100 --> 00:06:49,380
keep my nose to my studies

176
00:06:49,380 --> 00:06:52,139
excellent Watson I'm sure your sacrifice

177
00:06:52,139 --> 00:06:54,060
will not be in vain

178
00:06:54,060 --> 00:06:56,400
I really did not see myself sacrificing

179
00:06:56,400 --> 00:06:57,900
very much at all

180
00:06:57,900 --> 00:06:59,580
I spent the evening canceling all

181
00:06:59,580 --> 00:07:01,259
appointments of the following week and

182
00:07:01,259 --> 00:07:03,120
went to bed rather looking forward to a

183
00:07:03,120 --> 00:07:07,100
few days of fruitful incarceration

184
00:07:07,560 --> 00:07:10,020
the morning found me in a hopeful mood

185
00:07:10,020 --> 00:07:11,840
in what appeared to be an empty house

186
00:07:11,840 --> 00:07:14,340
Holmes I presumed had already descended

187
00:07:14,340 --> 00:07:17,039
to his basement laboratory our landlady

188
00:07:17,039 --> 00:07:19,620
Mrs Hudson had left me a pleasant cold

189
00:07:19,620 --> 00:07:22,259
breakfast an indication that she herself

190
00:07:22,259 --> 00:07:24,720
had had to leave the house early the day

191
00:07:24,720 --> 00:07:26,639
while already warm and bright had not

192
00:07:26,639 --> 00:07:29,280
yet begun to turn oppressive the clock

193
00:07:29,280 --> 00:07:32,280
over the half ticked slowly as I settled

194
00:07:32,280 --> 00:07:34,560
down to my books experiencing for the

195
00:07:34,560 --> 00:07:36,419
first time since my student years some

196
00:07:36,419 --> 00:07:40,199
of the quiet Ecstasy of study

197
00:07:40,199 --> 00:07:43,560
by midday the room had become hot

198
00:07:43,560 --> 00:07:45,900
my concentration meandered and thirst

199
00:07:45,900 --> 00:07:47,400
plagued me

200
00:07:47,400 --> 00:07:49,680
I wandered downstairs to Mrs Hudson's

201
00:07:49,680 --> 00:07:51,660
apartment and found her still absent so

202
00:07:51,660 --> 00:07:53,699
I proceeded down to the basement to ask

203
00:07:53,699 --> 00:07:55,620
Holmes whether he knew what arrangements

204
00:07:55,620 --> 00:07:57,960
had been made for lunch the door to the

205
00:07:57,960 --> 00:07:59,940
basement was shut and when I tried the

206
00:07:59,940 --> 00:08:02,639
handle I found it to be locked from

207
00:08:02,639 --> 00:08:04,259
within I could hear the occasional crack

208
00:08:04,259 --> 00:08:06,300
of what sounded like a gun being fired

209
00:08:06,300 --> 00:08:08,940
and the grind of metal on metal like

210
00:08:08,940 --> 00:08:10,919
ball bearings rolling round and Iron

211
00:08:10,919 --> 00:08:12,060
Bowl

212
00:08:12,060 --> 00:08:14,099
homes are you there

213
00:08:14,099 --> 00:08:16,259
Watson what are you doing here

214
00:08:16,259 --> 00:08:18,740
I'm in the process of an investigation

215
00:08:18,740 --> 00:08:22,080
indeed yes I'm trying to find out what's

216
00:08:22,080 --> 00:08:24,419
happening about luncheon we'll have to

217
00:08:24,419 --> 00:08:26,160
prepare something for yourself he called

218
00:08:26,160 --> 00:08:28,500
back I'm afraid I've sent Mrs Hudson

219
00:08:28,500 --> 00:08:30,539
away I cannot risk the lives of innocent

220
00:08:30,539 --> 00:08:33,000
people and Watson be so good as to keep

221
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:34,559
away from the basement

222
00:08:34,559 --> 00:08:37,140
confine yourself to our own rooms and to

223
00:08:37,140 --> 00:08:38,820
the kitchen there's a good fellow very

224
00:08:38,820 --> 00:08:41,399
well Holmes but yes

225
00:08:41,399 --> 00:08:42,958
I really would very much like a

226
00:08:42,958 --> 00:08:44,459
newspaper

227
00:08:44,459 --> 00:08:46,680
I'm afraid you must too without neither

228
00:08:46,680 --> 00:08:47,940
of us could take the chance of leaving

229
00:08:47,940 --> 00:08:49,740
here until this business is complete now

230
00:08:49,740 --> 00:08:52,320
please let me get on

231
00:08:52,320 --> 00:08:55,440
I trundled to the kitchen I managed to

232
00:08:55,440 --> 00:08:57,060
find myself some bread and cheese which

233
00:08:57,060 --> 00:08:58,920
I took back upstairs

234
00:08:58,920 --> 00:09:01,620
our rooms were now very hot and since I

235
00:09:01,620 --> 00:09:03,660
was forbidden to sit near the window I

236
00:09:03,660 --> 00:09:06,000
ate my luncheon over my books dropping

237
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:07,800
crumbs into the creases of Gray's

238
00:09:07,800 --> 00:09:11,100
Anatomy and beginning to feel Restless

239
00:09:11,100 --> 00:09:13,680
after lunch I managed to force myself to

240
00:09:13,680 --> 00:09:16,080
a little more work but by three o'clock

241
00:09:16,080 --> 00:09:19,200
had fallen asleep in the armchair

242
00:09:19,200 --> 00:09:21,959
I woke to hear the sounds of evening

243
00:09:21,959 --> 00:09:24,540
traffic moving along Baker Street

244
00:09:24,540 --> 00:09:26,760
I listened with something like Envy to

245
00:09:26,760 --> 00:09:29,100
the busy hubbub of those who were free

246
00:09:29,100 --> 00:09:31,680
to come and go who had families to

247
00:09:31,680 --> 00:09:34,200
return to and simple feasts awaiting

248
00:09:34,200 --> 00:09:37,019
them at convivial tables

249
00:09:37,019 --> 00:09:41,040
my lot seemed Bleak by comparison Holmes

250
00:09:41,040 --> 00:09:42,959
did not emerge from his infernal

251
00:09:42,959 --> 00:09:45,480
basement and Mrs Hudson did not appear

252
00:09:45,480 --> 00:09:47,339
with an evening meal

253
00:09:47,339 --> 00:09:49,320
I cannot recall how the rest of the

254
00:09:49,320 --> 00:09:51,779
evening passed the heat absorbed during

255
00:09:51,779 --> 00:09:53,519
the day by London's Pavements now

256
00:09:53,519 --> 00:09:55,940
radiated back to thicken the evening air

257
00:09:55,940 --> 00:09:59,360
the world outside of which I had no news

258
00:09:59,360 --> 00:10:03,180
became gradually silent and I hungry and

259
00:10:03,180 --> 00:10:07,320
disconsolate went finally to bed

260
00:10:07,320 --> 00:10:09,180
the next morning after a makeshift

261
00:10:09,180 --> 00:10:11,760
breakfast I got down to some work and

262
00:10:11,760 --> 00:10:13,560
was well into the argument of the paper

263
00:10:13,560 --> 00:10:15,899
I was writing when I began to realize

264
00:10:15,899 --> 00:10:17,760
that the room was again beginning to

265
00:10:17,760 --> 00:10:20,180
become airless and oven-like

266
00:10:20,180 --> 00:10:22,800
determined not to succumb to lethargy as

267
00:10:22,800 --> 00:10:25,320
I had the previous afternoon I decided

268
00:10:25,320 --> 00:10:27,660
that despite whom's strict embargo on

269
00:10:27,660 --> 00:10:30,600
going near the window I simply must have

270
00:10:30,600 --> 00:10:32,040
some air

271
00:10:32,040 --> 00:10:34,560
as I raised the sash I saw a cab

272
00:10:34,560 --> 00:10:36,660
approaching along Baker Street and

273
00:10:36,660 --> 00:10:38,940
stopping directly beneath the window

274
00:10:38,940 --> 00:10:41,459
the passenger who stepped out was

275
00:10:41,459 --> 00:10:44,100
Nicholas Cartwright an old University

276
00:10:44,100 --> 00:10:46,560
friend now writing for the times

277
00:10:46,560 --> 00:10:48,600
I hadn't seen him for a couple of months

278
00:10:48,600 --> 00:10:50,220
and he seemed about to pay a surprise

279
00:10:50,220 --> 00:10:51,060
visit

280
00:10:51,060 --> 00:10:53,880
desperate as I was for company I could

281
00:10:53,880 --> 00:10:55,440
not forget the promise I had made to

282
00:10:55,440 --> 00:10:58,560
Holmes to admit no visitors the doorbell

283
00:10:58,560 --> 00:11:00,480
rang

284
00:11:00,480 --> 00:11:02,700
my first idea was to wait for Cartwright

285
00:11:02,700 --> 00:11:05,040
to give up and go away but there quickly

286
00:11:05,040 --> 00:11:06,899
came a second ring and with it a call

287
00:11:06,899 --> 00:11:08,700
from the street through the now open

288
00:11:08,700 --> 00:11:11,339
window Martin

289
00:11:11,339 --> 00:11:13,440
a note of anxiety in his voice

290
00:11:13,440 --> 00:11:16,560
suggesting that all was not well

291
00:11:16,560 --> 00:11:19,740
Cartwright was a good friend

292
00:11:19,740 --> 00:11:21,839
I did not see how I could linger there

293
00:11:21,839 --> 00:11:23,399
pretending to be deaf when he might be

294
00:11:23,399 --> 00:11:25,079
in need of my help

295
00:11:25,079 --> 00:11:27,660
I dashed down the stairs and opened the

296
00:11:27,660 --> 00:11:28,980
front door

297
00:11:28,980 --> 00:11:32,040
Watson so pleased to have found you

298
00:11:32,040 --> 00:11:34,320
the statement immediately struck me as

299
00:11:34,320 --> 00:11:36,959
odd as did Cartwright's whole demeanor

300
00:11:36,959 --> 00:11:39,300
but mindful of the proximity of homes in

301
00:11:39,300 --> 00:11:41,459
his makeshift laboratory I whispered

302
00:11:41,459 --> 00:11:44,459
local chap odd things are going on come

303
00:11:44,459 --> 00:11:46,320
up as quietly as you can I'll explain

304
00:11:46,320 --> 00:11:49,380
there a sudden sharp crack issued from

305
00:11:49,380 --> 00:11:51,360
the depths of the house and I hoped that

306
00:11:51,360 --> 00:11:53,940
preoccupied as he was Holmes would have

307
00:11:53,940 --> 00:11:56,519
no inkling of the presence of my visitor

308
00:11:56,519 --> 00:11:58,920
as we entered the Parlor and shut the

309
00:11:58,920 --> 00:12:00,600
door Cartwright said

310
00:12:00,600 --> 00:12:02,760
Watson I've been worried about you

311
00:12:02,760 --> 00:12:05,399
I didn't even know if I'd find you here

312
00:12:05,399 --> 00:12:08,640
worried yes the story in The Gazette

313
00:12:08,640 --> 00:12:10,860
regarding yourself and Mr Holmes did you

314
00:12:10,860 --> 00:12:12,899
know it was in the papers

315
00:12:12,899 --> 00:12:16,079
Cartwright I haven't the least idea what

316
00:12:16,079 --> 00:12:17,459
you're talking about and as for

317
00:12:17,459 --> 00:12:19,560
newspapers I haven't seen one in days

318
00:12:19,560 --> 00:12:21,720
here he tossed me the paper open at

319
00:12:21,720 --> 00:12:23,220
about the third or fourth page and I

320
00:12:23,220 --> 00:12:24,420
read the following headline in

321
00:12:24,420 --> 00:12:26,160
accompanying article

322
00:12:26,160 --> 00:12:29,160
Sherlock Holmes and Dr Watson part

323
00:12:29,160 --> 00:12:31,079
company

324
00:12:31,079 --> 00:12:32,760
after several years of celebrated

325
00:12:32,760 --> 00:12:34,620
collaboration the eminent Consulting

326
00:12:34,620 --> 00:12:36,540
detective Mr Sherlock Holmes in his

327
00:12:36,540 --> 00:12:39,060
medical companion Dr John Watson

328
00:12:39,060 --> 00:12:41,040
have terminated their professional

329
00:12:41,040 --> 00:12:43,320
partnership and it seems simultaneously

330
00:12:43,320 --> 00:12:46,079
ended their personal friendship

331
00:12:46,079 --> 00:12:48,300
Mr Holmes said that Wally continued to

332
00:12:48,300 --> 00:12:50,820
hold Dr Watson in high esteem and to

333
00:12:50,820 --> 00:12:52,139
regard him as a matter of exceptional

334
00:12:52,139 --> 00:12:53,760
honor and professional competence

335
00:12:53,760 --> 00:12:55,740
circumstances upon which he could not

336
00:12:55,740 --> 00:12:57,779
and would not elaborate had made it

337
00:12:57,779 --> 00:12:59,339
expedient for them to go their separate

338
00:12:59,339 --> 00:13:00,680
ways

339
00:13:00,680 --> 00:13:04,740
there was no comment from Dr Watson

340
00:13:04,740 --> 00:13:06,540
I stood for a moment holding the

341
00:13:06,540 --> 00:13:08,220
newspaper and diverting my gaze from

342
00:13:08,220 --> 00:13:09,420
Cartwright

343
00:13:09,420 --> 00:13:12,540
who had written this did Holmes know

344
00:13:12,540 --> 00:13:13,560
about it

345
00:13:13,560 --> 00:13:16,680
was there some truth in it was Holmes is

346
00:13:16,680 --> 00:13:18,360
exiled to the basement a way of keeping

347
00:13:18,360 --> 00:13:20,040
me at Bay while he found alternative

348
00:13:20,040 --> 00:13:21,480
lodgings

349
00:13:21,480 --> 00:13:25,380
this is today's Gazette yes Watson I see

350
00:13:25,380 --> 00:13:27,420
you knew nothing about this

351
00:13:27,420 --> 00:13:28,740
am I speaking to you as a friend

352
00:13:28,740 --> 00:13:31,680
Cartwright or as a journalist well I

353
00:13:31,680 --> 00:13:35,040
suppose unfortunately as a friend John I

354
00:13:35,040 --> 00:13:36,660
say unfortunately because this is

355
00:13:36,660 --> 00:13:39,120
clearly a damn good story but if you

356
00:13:39,120 --> 00:13:40,740
wish to talk to me off the Record so be

357
00:13:40,740 --> 00:13:41,639
it

358
00:13:41,639 --> 00:13:43,620
off the Record then

359
00:13:43,620 --> 00:13:46,380
I know nothing of this and I don't know

360
00:13:46,380 --> 00:13:48,420
whether Holmes has had a hand in it he's

361
00:13:48,420 --> 00:13:50,220
conducting some very secret business at

362
00:13:50,220 --> 00:13:52,320
present and possibly it's connected to

363
00:13:52,320 --> 00:13:54,300
that that's all I can tell you I'm

364
00:13:54,300 --> 00:13:55,800
afraid

365
00:13:55,800 --> 00:13:58,260
one thing does baffle me Cartwright said

366
00:13:58,260 --> 00:14:00,240
how did The Gazette get the story

367
00:14:00,240 --> 00:14:02,519
without us getting it too anyway I won't

368
00:14:02,519 --> 00:14:04,260
make anything of this John until you

369
00:14:04,260 --> 00:14:07,380
give me the go-ahead but I hope if there

370
00:14:07,380 --> 00:14:09,959
does turn out to be an exclusive

371
00:14:09,959 --> 00:14:13,019
you'll be the one to get it I said Thank

372
00:14:13,019 --> 00:14:15,240
You Nicholas I saw him down the stairs

373
00:14:15,240 --> 00:14:16,680
and closed the front door behind him

374
00:14:16,680 --> 00:14:20,339
finding myself relieved that he had gone

375
00:14:20,339 --> 00:14:22,500
I had no idea that I would be singing

376
00:14:22,500 --> 00:14:25,260
him again soon under even more peculiar

377
00:14:25,260 --> 00:14:26,639
circumstances

378
00:14:26,639 --> 00:14:29,519
but determined that now I must confront

379
00:14:29,519 --> 00:14:31,500
homes with this business

380
00:14:31,500 --> 00:14:34,440
I knocked on the door of the basement

381
00:14:34,440 --> 00:14:36,839
homes

382
00:14:36,839 --> 00:14:39,180
a long silence

383
00:14:39,180 --> 00:14:42,540
ohms we must speak

384
00:14:42,540 --> 00:14:44,519
not now Watson

385
00:14:44,519 --> 00:14:46,199
Holmes there's something I must discuss

386
00:14:46,199 --> 00:14:48,240
with you urgently something in the

387
00:14:48,240 --> 00:14:49,740
newspaper

388
00:14:49,740 --> 00:14:51,300
there was a scuffling in the basement

389
00:14:51,300 --> 00:14:53,040
door opened

390
00:14:53,040 --> 00:14:57,000
newspaper how did you get a newspaper

391
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:59,880
Cartwright called he'd seen an article

392
00:14:59,880 --> 00:15:03,899
yes Holmes interrupted yes the article

393
00:15:03,899 --> 00:15:05,820
I dare say you would appreciate an

394
00:15:05,820 --> 00:15:07,440
explanation

395
00:15:07,440 --> 00:15:10,699
give me half an hour

396
00:15:10,740 --> 00:15:12,600
a little later we sat opposite one

397
00:15:12,600 --> 00:15:14,699
another in our sitting room the evening

398
00:15:14,699 --> 00:15:17,579
was still close and oppressive

399
00:15:17,579 --> 00:15:21,540
the newspaper article said Holmes was an

400
00:15:21,540 --> 00:15:23,459
unfortunate necessity

401
00:15:23,459 --> 00:15:25,260
I hope it has not caused you too much

402
00:15:25,260 --> 00:15:27,180
embarrassment Watson and when this

403
00:15:27,180 --> 00:15:28,740
business is finished all will be

404
00:15:28,740 --> 00:15:30,300
rectified

405
00:15:30,300 --> 00:15:33,720
why I said reporters is having quarreled

406
00:15:33,720 --> 00:15:36,120
bear with me Watson I beg of you

407
00:15:36,120 --> 00:15:38,399
as you know I have tried to keep my work

408
00:15:38,399 --> 00:15:40,980
here secret but how certain can one be

409
00:15:40,980 --> 00:15:43,740
of that the police are involved in these

410
00:15:43,740 --> 00:15:45,720
matters and are aware of my experiments

411
00:15:45,720 --> 00:15:48,060
and who knows whether some junior or

412
00:15:48,060 --> 00:15:49,920
even senior member of the force is not

413
00:15:49,920 --> 00:15:51,839
in League with that utterly ruthless

414
00:15:51,839 --> 00:15:52,980
villain

415
00:15:52,980 --> 00:15:54,180
now

416
00:15:54,180 --> 00:15:56,160
having been alerted to that newspaper

417
00:15:56,160 --> 00:15:57,779
report might it not be the case that

418
00:15:57,779 --> 00:15:59,639
Tobias organ would assume that you were

419
00:15:59,639 --> 00:16:02,519
no longer in London at any rate he would

420
00:16:02,519 --> 00:16:04,620
certainly be likely to assume you were

421
00:16:04,620 --> 00:16:07,260
no longer sharing these premises with me

422
00:16:07,260 --> 00:16:09,839
you gave the story to The Gazette to

423
00:16:09,839 --> 00:16:13,019
protect me yes Watson that was my

424
00:16:13,019 --> 00:16:14,160
purpose

425
00:16:14,160 --> 00:16:16,920
I just wish that you'd consulted me

426
00:16:16,920 --> 00:16:18,000
first

427
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:20,220
you were not supposed even to know about

428
00:16:20,220 --> 00:16:22,980
it Watson and if you had not had a visit

429
00:16:22,980 --> 00:16:24,660
from Cartwright you would never have

430
00:16:24,660 --> 00:16:27,660
seen the article it was unfortunate that

431
00:16:27,660 --> 00:16:29,160
he came when he did

432
00:16:29,160 --> 00:16:32,040
it was the article that brought him yes

433
00:16:32,040 --> 00:16:34,920
a miscalculation on my part

434
00:16:34,920 --> 00:16:37,740
now it is late work to do tomorrow and I

435
00:16:37,740 --> 00:16:39,240
must insist on extracting from you

436
00:16:39,240 --> 00:16:42,240
another guarantee what's that Holmes

437
00:16:42,240 --> 00:16:44,040
that you will not under any

438
00:16:44,040 --> 00:16:46,860
circumstances interrupt my work again

439
00:16:46,860 --> 00:16:48,720
it's all very delicate in a disturbance

440
00:16:48,720 --> 00:16:50,399
at an inopportune moment could ruin

441
00:16:50,399 --> 00:16:52,920
everything is that clear not under any

442
00:16:52,920 --> 00:16:55,820
circumstance

443
00:16:56,160 --> 00:16:58,620
that night I lay awake in the muggy heat

444
00:16:58,620 --> 00:17:01,139
the bed clothes pulled back and grieved

445
00:17:01,139 --> 00:17:03,120
for what I calculated to be the death of

446
00:17:03,120 --> 00:17:05,040
my reputation

447
00:17:05,040 --> 00:17:07,559
at least I imagined that's how the world

448
00:17:07,559 --> 00:17:09,240
would see it or at least that portion of

449
00:17:09,240 --> 00:17:11,900
the world that reads the London Gazette

450
00:17:11,900 --> 00:17:14,959
Holmes and Watson have parted company

451
00:17:14,959 --> 00:17:18,059
but there is no comment from Watson only

452
00:17:18,059 --> 00:17:20,459
a nobly worded valediction from the

453
00:17:20,459 --> 00:17:22,679
Greek Detective

454
00:17:22,679 --> 00:17:25,380
such bitter thoughts polluted my

455
00:17:25,380 --> 00:17:28,020
Restless waking and tormented my

456
00:17:28,020 --> 00:17:29,640
subsequent dreams

457
00:17:29,640 --> 00:17:31,919
and added to all this their layers

458
00:17:31,919 --> 00:17:34,740
sensed that things were still not clear

459
00:17:34,740 --> 00:17:39,120
that something crucial remained unspoken

460
00:17:39,120 --> 00:17:43,440
I woke early but exhausted without going

461
00:17:43,440 --> 00:17:45,720
near the window I took in what I could

462
00:17:45,720 --> 00:17:47,400
of the Awakening day

463
00:17:47,400 --> 00:17:50,700
the street was quiet

464
00:17:50,700 --> 00:17:53,160
I dressed slowly and descended to the

465
00:17:53,160 --> 00:17:55,799
kitchen to find something to eat the

466
00:17:55,799 --> 00:17:57,960
rattles and sharp cracks of homes's

467
00:17:57,960 --> 00:17:59,760
experiments had already come to life

468
00:17:59,760 --> 00:18:01,380
below in the basement

469
00:18:01,380 --> 00:18:03,000
and they wondered whether he had even

470
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:04,980
bothered to go to bed

471
00:18:04,980 --> 00:18:07,320
I was making a pot of tea when the

472
00:18:07,320 --> 00:18:09,299
doorbell sounded

473
00:18:09,299 --> 00:18:11,340
the noises from The Cellar did not pause

474
00:18:11,340 --> 00:18:13,440
so I assumed that Holmes had not heard

475
00:18:13,440 --> 00:18:14,700
the Bell

476
00:18:14,700 --> 00:18:16,500
I could see nothing off the front of the

477
00:18:16,500 --> 00:18:18,480
house from the kitchen but after I'd

478
00:18:18,480 --> 00:18:21,539
taken a few steps up into the lobby it

479
00:18:21,539 --> 00:18:23,400
became clear by means of a side window

480
00:18:23,400 --> 00:18:25,980
that the visitor was once again Nicholas

481
00:18:25,980 --> 00:18:27,179
Cartwright

482
00:18:27,179 --> 00:18:29,700
I went to the door and admitted him

483
00:18:29,700 --> 00:18:31,679
cut right

484
00:18:31,679 --> 00:18:33,660
what's going on Watson

485
00:18:33,660 --> 00:18:36,059
what do you mean I mean what game is

486
00:18:36,059 --> 00:18:37,380
being played here

487
00:18:37,380 --> 00:18:39,960
cut right I've no idea what you're

488
00:18:39,960 --> 00:18:42,120
referring to you better come up

489
00:18:42,120 --> 00:18:44,940
he was I could tell steaming with anger

490
00:18:44,940 --> 00:18:46,919
though I had no idea what I could have

491
00:18:46,919 --> 00:18:49,320
done to arouse it he would not sit he

492
00:18:49,320 --> 00:18:51,480
stood with his arms behind his back a

493
00:18:51,480 --> 00:18:54,320
man preparing to deliver an accusation

494
00:18:54,320 --> 00:18:57,299
you told me you were inescapably

495
00:18:57,299 --> 00:18:59,340
confined to this house

496
00:18:59,340 --> 00:19:01,559
yes Cartwright and so I have been this

497
00:19:01,559 --> 00:19:03,960
is the third day excluding yesterday

498
00:19:03,960 --> 00:19:07,740
night you mean no I was here yesterday

499
00:19:07,740 --> 00:19:09,660
night too tossing and turning in my bed

500
00:19:09,660 --> 00:19:12,500
at them thought of my ruined reputation

501
00:19:12,500 --> 00:19:15,780
see here yesterday you prevailed upon my

502
00:19:15,780 --> 00:19:17,460
friendship by confiding in me matters

503
00:19:17,460 --> 00:19:19,200
which as a journalist I considered more

504
00:19:19,200 --> 00:19:20,880
than worthy of publication

505
00:19:20,880 --> 00:19:23,160
had I known that you were deceiving me

506
00:19:23,160 --> 00:19:25,860
Cartwright you have my word I was not

507
00:19:25,860 --> 00:19:28,380
deceiving you I have not left this house

508
00:19:28,380 --> 00:19:30,360
since Monday afternoon

509
00:19:30,360 --> 00:19:34,799
so you have a twin brother no I do not

510
00:19:34,799 --> 00:19:36,960
then please explain to me who was the

511
00:19:36,960 --> 00:19:39,000
man outside the restaurant at marlabone

512
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:41,100
station at five past midnight

513
00:19:41,100 --> 00:19:44,400
I take it he resembled me more than

514
00:19:44,400 --> 00:19:46,980
resembled I do hope you're being

515
00:19:46,980 --> 00:19:49,860
truthful with me Watson

516
00:19:49,860 --> 00:19:51,960
I could see that his suspicions were not

517
00:19:51,960 --> 00:19:54,600
a laid I even began to wonder whether my

518
00:19:54,600 --> 00:19:56,100
Restless period of waking the previous

519
00:19:56,100 --> 00:19:57,840
night had itself been a dream and

520
00:19:57,840 --> 00:20:00,299
whether I had been sleepwalking

521
00:20:00,299 --> 00:20:02,280
such things are possible I know and the

522
00:20:02,280 --> 00:20:04,260
heat my fatigue and the events of the

523
00:20:04,260 --> 00:20:07,020
last days had left me so baffled that in

524
00:20:07,020 --> 00:20:09,120
that moment of confusion I could not

525
00:20:09,120 --> 00:20:11,039
entirely rule it out

526
00:20:11,039 --> 00:20:14,460
what happened he said was that I was

527
00:20:14,460 --> 00:20:15,960
walking through the station Concourse

528
00:20:15,960 --> 00:20:17,580
when I spotted you by the wall of the

529
00:20:17,580 --> 00:20:19,260
restaurant which by then was closed

530
00:20:19,260 --> 00:20:22,440
talking to a man in a brown felt hat I

531
00:20:22,440 --> 00:20:24,600
would have approached you but when I

532
00:20:24,600 --> 00:20:27,720
caught your eye you cut me as dead as if

533
00:20:27,720 --> 00:20:30,059
you didn't know me and I assumed your

534
00:20:30,059 --> 00:20:32,700
conversation was of some importance

535
00:20:32,700 --> 00:20:34,740
the more I thought about it the more I

536
00:20:34,740 --> 00:20:36,960
thought it was a poor way to treat a

537
00:20:36,960 --> 00:20:38,880
good friend

538
00:20:38,880 --> 00:20:41,940
suddenly the fog in my brain gave way to

539
00:20:41,940 --> 00:20:43,740
an horrific clarity

540
00:20:43,740 --> 00:20:46,200
I knew that I must rid myself of

541
00:20:46,200 --> 00:20:48,780
Cartwright at once

542
00:20:48,780 --> 00:20:51,660
thank you for telling me this I said it

543
00:20:51,660 --> 00:20:54,600
is of the utmost importance but Nicholas

544
00:20:54,600 --> 00:20:57,539
and I pray you won't take this amiss

545
00:20:57,539 --> 00:21:00,299
I must ask you to leave

546
00:21:00,299 --> 00:21:04,020
to leave please this is a fearfully

547
00:21:04,020 --> 00:21:05,400
serious business

548
00:21:05,400 --> 00:21:07,559
there is real Danger

549
00:21:07,559 --> 00:21:09,120
you're not just trying to get me out of

550
00:21:09,120 --> 00:21:11,700
the way Watson that's exactly what I'm

551
00:21:11,700 --> 00:21:13,559
trying to do Cartwright but preferred a

552
00:21:13,559 --> 00:21:16,679
very good reason believe me you will

553
00:21:16,679 --> 00:21:19,140
have your story

554
00:21:19,140 --> 00:21:22,919
very well John very well

555
00:21:22,919 --> 00:21:25,080
at the front door he patted me amiably

556
00:21:25,080 --> 00:21:26,340
on the shoulder

557
00:21:26,340 --> 00:21:28,440
I shut the door on him and leaned

558
00:21:28,440 --> 00:21:30,059
against the wall trying to get my

559
00:21:30,059 --> 00:21:32,100
thoughts in order

560
00:21:32,100 --> 00:21:34,799
Holmes had instructed me not under any

561
00:21:34,799 --> 00:21:37,140
circumstances to trouble him again

562
00:21:37,140 --> 00:21:40,440
yet this situation was possibly critical

563
00:21:40,440 --> 00:21:42,419
if Tobias organ had hired some

564
00:21:42,419 --> 00:21:45,240
impersonated look and sound so like me

565
00:21:45,240 --> 00:21:47,280
that even Cartwright who had known me

566
00:21:47,280 --> 00:21:50,460
for years could be convinced then Holmes

567
00:21:50,460 --> 00:21:53,400
might also be deceived and then

568
00:21:53,400 --> 00:21:55,980
what power they would have in their

569
00:21:55,980 --> 00:21:57,179
hands

570
00:21:57,179 --> 00:21:59,400
if I could not speak to Holmes I could

571
00:21:59,400 --> 00:22:02,100
at least alert him by other means

572
00:22:02,100 --> 00:22:04,140
I ran up the stairs with the idea of

573
00:22:04,140 --> 00:22:06,000
writing a note which I could slip under

574
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:09,120
the basement door but as I reached our

575
00:22:09,120 --> 00:22:12,000
rooms I heard a cry from the street

576
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:14,340
without thinking I ran to the Parlor

577
00:22:14,340 --> 00:22:16,559
window a hundred yards southwards along

578
00:22:16,559 --> 00:22:18,720
Baker Street three men were struggling

579
00:22:18,720 --> 00:22:21,179
two of them were bundling the third man

580
00:22:21,179 --> 00:22:23,940
into a cab against his will

581
00:22:23,940 --> 00:22:25,860
it was Cartwright

582
00:22:25,860 --> 00:22:28,020
I dashed down the stairs and ran into

583
00:22:28,020 --> 00:22:29,760
the street the driver of the cab had

584
00:22:29,760 --> 00:22:31,320
already whipped up the horse and moved

585
00:22:31,320 --> 00:22:33,480
off at a lick but I gave Chase Fury and

586
00:22:33,480 --> 00:22:36,120
outrage fuming my progress I pursued

587
00:22:36,120 --> 00:22:37,320
them for a good half a mile until

588
00:22:37,320 --> 00:22:39,720
eventually they are paced me and I stood

589
00:22:39,720 --> 00:22:41,760
gasping for breath outside Saint

590
00:22:41,760 --> 00:22:44,580
Vincent's church

591
00:22:44,580 --> 00:22:46,620
sat on the pavement

592
00:22:46,620 --> 00:22:49,140
I needed Holmes's help

593
00:22:49,140 --> 00:22:51,539
the transgression of a broken promise

594
00:22:51,539 --> 00:22:53,580
was a trivial thing surely in the

595
00:22:53,580 --> 00:22:56,460
context of this appalling incident

596
00:22:56,460 --> 00:23:00,240
I would go to him immediately

597
00:23:00,240 --> 00:23:03,000
aware that in the haste of my Pursuit

598
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:04,860
I'd left the front door of the house

599
00:23:04,860 --> 00:23:05,940
open

600
00:23:05,940 --> 00:23:08,880
a new anxiety overcame me

601
00:23:08,880 --> 00:23:10,799
clearly this kidnap was the work of

602
00:23:10,799 --> 00:23:12,659
organs Ruffians and who was to say that

603
00:23:12,659 --> 00:23:14,340
they would not take advantage of an open

604
00:23:14,340 --> 00:23:16,799
door I trotted as priskly as I could

605
00:23:16,799 --> 00:23:18,780
back to Baker Street

606
00:23:18,780 --> 00:23:22,140
but the door was no longer open

607
00:23:22,140 --> 00:23:24,659
and on such a close and windless day I

608
00:23:24,659 --> 00:23:26,520
thought it unlikely it had been closed

609
00:23:26,520 --> 00:23:28,140
by a draft

610
00:23:28,140 --> 00:23:30,480
the horrible thought occurred to me that

611
00:23:30,480 --> 00:23:33,419
someone may have already got in

612
00:23:33,419 --> 00:23:36,960
and then everything seemed to Tumble

613
00:23:36,960 --> 00:23:39,780
into place Cartwright's abduction had

614
00:23:39,780 --> 00:23:41,280
been intended to draw me out of the

615
00:23:41,280 --> 00:23:43,140
house so that the man masquerading as

616
00:23:43,140 --> 00:23:45,539
myself could gain entry

617
00:23:45,539 --> 00:23:48,240
Holmes would be unaware of this he would

618
00:23:48,240 --> 00:23:49,860
eventually open the door of the basement

619
00:23:49,860 --> 00:23:52,020
to his assailant and believing it was

620
00:23:52,020 --> 00:23:54,600
myself he was admitting would offer the

621
00:23:54,600 --> 00:23:57,299
easiest of targets I'd left the house

622
00:23:57,299 --> 00:23:59,159
without a key but I knew there was a

623
00:23:59,159 --> 00:24:01,440
possibility of access via the rear of

624
00:24:01,440 --> 00:24:02,580
the Terrace

625
00:24:02,580 --> 00:24:05,039
this entailed my knocking at the door of

626
00:24:05,039 --> 00:24:08,039
our neighbor Mrs Harbin an elderly

627
00:24:08,039 --> 00:24:10,559
amiable woman who seemed happy to allow

628
00:24:10,559 --> 00:24:13,080
me access to the rear of the building

629
00:24:13,080 --> 00:24:15,659
here I was obliged to scale a wall to

630
00:24:15,659 --> 00:24:17,640
the yard outside the back of our own

631
00:24:17,640 --> 00:24:20,340
dingy basement the front room being that

632
00:24:20,340 --> 00:24:22,200
which Holmes had taken for his makeshift

633
00:24:22,200 --> 00:24:23,340
Laboratory

634
00:24:23,340 --> 00:24:25,980
there was no Light Within

635
00:24:25,980 --> 00:24:29,340
I opened the door with infinite slowness

636
00:24:29,340 --> 00:24:32,220
the noise of Holmes's experiments seemed

637
00:24:32,220 --> 00:24:33,900
to have stopped

638
00:24:33,900 --> 00:24:36,000
the door that connected this room to the

639
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:38,400
front half of the basement was six or

640
00:24:38,400 --> 00:24:41,220
seven short Paces away but it was too

641
00:24:41,220 --> 00:24:43,200
dark to see whether the bare floorboards

642
00:24:43,200 --> 00:24:45,360
were liable to move and groan when I

643
00:24:45,360 --> 00:24:46,740
trod upon them

644
00:24:46,740 --> 00:24:49,440
I tested each step before lowering my

645
00:24:49,440 --> 00:24:51,600
weight and moved with the floating

646
00:24:51,600 --> 00:24:54,539
motion of a rather overweight pantomime

647
00:24:54,539 --> 00:24:57,120
artist one

648
00:24:57,120 --> 00:25:01,020
two three then there was movement behind

649
00:25:01,020 --> 00:25:02,700
me a hand was clamped across my mouth

650
00:25:02,700 --> 00:25:04,440
and an arm locked around my throat the

651
00:25:04,440 --> 00:25:06,780
grip was expert I could not breathe or

652
00:25:06,780 --> 00:25:09,539
move the hot breath of my assailant in

653
00:25:09,539 --> 00:25:12,120
my ear whispered oh God

654
00:25:12,120 --> 00:25:13,679
do not cry out

655
00:25:13,679 --> 00:25:15,539
I'm gonna release you a new turn around

656
00:25:15,539 --> 00:25:19,440
slowly and face me you must

657
00:25:19,440 --> 00:25:23,220
you must cap our hand if you understand

658
00:25:23,220 --> 00:25:24,960
I reached up to the hand around my

659
00:25:24,960 --> 00:25:27,480
throat and obediently I tapped it the

660
00:25:27,480 --> 00:25:29,340
arm released me and as quietly as I

661
00:25:29,340 --> 00:25:31,860
could I took a deep draft of air turning

662
00:25:31,860 --> 00:25:35,100
as I did so astrayed shhh yes doctor

663
00:25:35,100 --> 00:25:38,700
wasn't expecting you here or rather in a

664
00:25:38,700 --> 00:25:40,860
sense I was but since you are just about

665
00:25:40,860 --> 00:25:42,840
to arrive I wasn't expecting you to come

666
00:25:42,840 --> 00:25:45,240
in the back way as well the policeman

667
00:25:45,240 --> 00:25:48,000
smirked at his little conundrum when he

668
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:50,460
explained to me I began what on Earth

669
00:25:50,460 --> 00:25:53,520
you mean not now doctor he said

670
00:25:53,520 --> 00:25:55,380
glad you're here though sir an

671
00:25:55,380 --> 00:25:57,600
additional pair of ears up close to the

672
00:25:57,600 --> 00:26:00,299
door now and listen it won't be long

673
00:26:00,299 --> 00:26:02,460
it was indeed less than a minute before

674
00:26:02,460 --> 00:26:04,140
we heard the door from the front of the

675
00:26:04,140 --> 00:26:06,360
house opening into the laboratory and

676
00:26:06,360 --> 00:26:08,580
the arrival of what sounded like two men

677
00:26:08,580 --> 00:26:11,820
the door was closed with a thump and a

678
00:26:11,820 --> 00:26:13,860
Gruff voice said

679
00:26:13,860 --> 00:26:16,500
so this is it yes this is where he's

680
00:26:16,500 --> 00:26:17,580
working

681
00:26:17,580 --> 00:26:19,559
there was something familiar about that

682
00:26:19,559 --> 00:26:22,140
second voice and he won't be back for a

683
00:26:22,140 --> 00:26:25,679
while no but half an hour I should think

684
00:26:25,679 --> 00:26:27,779
at that moment with a shock I recognized

685
00:26:27,779 --> 00:26:30,120
the other voice it was my own

686
00:26:30,120 --> 00:26:32,940
I tend to lestrade again but he just put

687
00:26:32,940 --> 00:26:34,679
his finger to his lips and indicated

688
00:26:34,679 --> 00:26:37,140
that I should continue to listen

689
00:26:37,140 --> 00:26:39,840
so what's the plan then ask the graph

690
00:26:39,840 --> 00:26:42,299
Voice Within to match the bullet that

691
00:26:42,299 --> 00:26:44,400
killed maximum with the ones from your

692
00:26:44,400 --> 00:26:46,559
gun said my voice

693
00:26:46,559 --> 00:26:49,260
the police know you killed him but they

694
00:26:49,260 --> 00:26:51,120
need homes to provide them with evidence

695
00:26:51,120 --> 00:26:53,279
that will convince a jury

696
00:26:53,279 --> 00:26:56,580
evidently I thought the gruff character

697
00:26:56,580 --> 00:26:59,880
is Tobias organ I heard him Pace about

698
00:26:59,880 --> 00:27:02,039
then spit noisily

699
00:27:02,039 --> 00:27:04,080
Zimmerman's not the first one I've

700
00:27:04,080 --> 00:27:07,320
topped and they've never got me yet they

701
00:27:07,320 --> 00:27:09,539
say you only got four pounds 10

702
00:27:09,539 --> 00:27:12,179
Shillings from him never you mind what I

703
00:27:12,179 --> 00:27:12,900
got

704
00:27:12,900 --> 00:27:14,880
anyway I never killed him just for the

705
00:27:14,880 --> 00:27:17,640
money I killed him because he gave me a

706
00:27:17,640 --> 00:27:20,580
bad look he gave me a bad look and I

707
00:27:20,580 --> 00:27:24,600
gave him a bad headache a bullet right

708
00:27:24,600 --> 00:27:26,400
between the eyes

709
00:27:26,400 --> 00:27:30,059
now let's deal with this little problem

710
00:27:30,059 --> 00:27:32,640
suddenly there was a tumultuous crash as

711
00:27:32,640 --> 00:27:35,159
if one of the walls had fallen in here

712
00:27:35,159 --> 00:27:37,799
we go doctor said lestrade he pushed the

713
00:27:37,799 --> 00:27:39,120
door harder we rushed into the

714
00:27:39,120 --> 00:27:40,620
laboratory where organ had kicked

715
00:27:40,620 --> 00:27:42,059
Holmes's equipment flying in all

716
00:27:42,059 --> 00:27:44,340
directions and where to my amazement I

717
00:27:44,340 --> 00:27:46,159
saw that he was now being attacked by

718
00:27:46,159 --> 00:27:50,279
myself a perfect duplicate of me cracked

719
00:27:50,279 --> 00:27:52,140
him a right hook then a left hook and

720
00:27:52,140 --> 00:27:54,000
then filled him with a blow to the side

721
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:56,640
of the head organ hit the floor like a

722
00:27:56,640 --> 00:27:59,279
sack of cabbages lestrade was on him in

723
00:27:59,279 --> 00:28:01,380
a Flash cuffing organ's arms behind his

724
00:28:01,380 --> 00:28:03,659
back lestrade blew his whistle and then

725
00:28:03,659 --> 00:28:05,880
proceeded to arrest him

726
00:28:05,880 --> 00:28:08,279
as I stood back to get a better look at

727
00:28:08,279 --> 00:28:11,220
my other self the duplicate doctor put a

728
00:28:11,220 --> 00:28:13,919
hand to his own face wrenched at his

729
00:28:13,919 --> 00:28:16,320
upper brow and pulled and stretched

730
00:28:16,320 --> 00:28:19,580
until he had removed his entire face

731
00:28:19,580 --> 00:28:23,340
revealing beneath the peeling mask the

732
00:28:23,340 --> 00:28:27,000
flaming eyes of Sherlock Holmes

733
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:29,880
the next moment lestrade's officers came

734
00:28:29,880 --> 00:28:32,340
bursting through the basement door and

735
00:28:32,340 --> 00:28:36,620
Tobias organ was dragged away

736
00:28:37,020 --> 00:28:39,720
the heat of the day had given way at

737
00:28:39,720 --> 00:28:42,240
last to a pleasant evening

738
00:28:42,240 --> 00:28:44,580
Mrs Hudson had returned to the house and

739
00:28:44,580 --> 00:28:46,440
provided homes and myself with an

740
00:28:46,440 --> 00:28:48,600
excellent evening meal

741
00:28:48,600 --> 00:28:51,360
now we sat with our brandies and homes

742
00:28:51,360 --> 00:28:54,419
with his pipe at the open window where a

743
00:28:54,419 --> 00:28:57,240
gentle breeze lifted the curtains and

744
00:28:57,240 --> 00:28:59,520
refreshed The Parlor

745
00:28:59,520 --> 00:29:01,740
as you will have deduced Holmes was

746
00:29:01,740 --> 00:29:03,600
saying by way of explaining it all to me

747
00:29:03,600 --> 00:29:06,059
the object of the Masquerade was to lure

748
00:29:06,059 --> 00:29:08,340
organ somewhere where we could extract a

749
00:29:08,340 --> 00:29:11,400
confession from him by subterfuge but

750
00:29:11,400 --> 00:29:14,460
your ballistics experiments I said would

751
00:29:14,460 --> 00:29:16,919
they not have been enough to convict him

752
00:29:16,919 --> 00:29:19,700
it is a science only in the imagination

753
00:29:19,700 --> 00:29:21,360
Holmes said

754
00:29:21,360 --> 00:29:23,100
and though one day I'm certain it will

755
00:29:23,100 --> 00:29:26,039
be more than that that is much more work

756
00:29:26,039 --> 00:29:27,899
to do than I could accomplish in a

757
00:29:27,899 --> 00:29:30,059
fortnight but lestrade and I agree that

758
00:29:30,059 --> 00:29:31,980
if organ believed himself to be at risk

759
00:29:31,980 --> 00:29:34,200
from my experiments he would wish to

760
00:29:34,200 --> 00:29:36,299
destroy them what on Earth were you

761
00:29:36,299 --> 00:29:37,860
doing in their homes if the thing was a

762
00:29:37,860 --> 00:29:39,240
complete hoax

763
00:29:39,240 --> 00:29:41,940
I'm afraid I did deceive you a little I

764
00:29:41,940 --> 00:29:44,159
was not in there all the time the

765
00:29:44,159 --> 00:29:46,500
mechanism of an Old Railway clock and a

766
00:29:46,500 --> 00:29:48,539
device employing elastic and a drum skin

767
00:29:48,539 --> 00:29:50,159
were intended to give the ear the

768
00:29:50,159 --> 00:29:54,059
impression of ongoing industry well it

769
00:29:54,059 --> 00:29:57,120
certainly deceived me I said but was it

770
00:29:57,120 --> 00:29:58,559
really necessary for me to be

771
00:29:58,559 --> 00:30:00,960
incarcerated for the duration

772
00:30:00,960 --> 00:30:04,080
I'm afraid so my friend if organ through

773
00:30:04,080 --> 00:30:05,640
one of his spies had got wind that there

774
00:30:05,640 --> 00:30:07,740
were two Watsons the trick would not

775
00:30:07,740 --> 00:30:08,760
have worked

776
00:30:08,760 --> 00:30:11,159
what's more it was necessary for him to

777
00:30:11,159 --> 00:30:13,679
believe that you and I had quarreled and

778
00:30:13,679 --> 00:30:15,779
therefore that the good Dr Watson might

779
00:30:15,779 --> 00:30:19,020
be in the market for a bit of betrayal

780
00:30:19,020 --> 00:30:21,299
unfortunately your friend Cartwright saw

781
00:30:21,299 --> 00:30:23,520
me meeting organs accomplice at malaban

782
00:30:23,520 --> 00:30:25,500
station and almost let the cat out of

783
00:30:25,500 --> 00:30:28,320
the bag it was necessary for us to put

784
00:30:28,320 --> 00:30:31,260
him somewhere safe lestrade's men kindly

785
00:30:31,260 --> 00:30:33,179
subjected him to a temporary and very

786
00:30:33,179 --> 00:30:35,940
comfortable period of kidnap it was you

787
00:30:35,940 --> 00:30:37,679
who had dragged away

788
00:30:37,679 --> 00:30:40,320
yes I had not calculated that you would

789
00:30:40,320 --> 00:30:41,760
follow him of course or that you would

790
00:30:41,760 --> 00:30:42,899
be locked out and find yourself

791
00:30:42,899 --> 00:30:44,880
clamoring in through the back

792
00:30:44,880 --> 00:30:47,820
but it turned out well you will make an

793
00:30:47,820 --> 00:30:50,159
additional witness for the prosecution

794
00:30:50,159 --> 00:30:52,679
do you think they'll convict him oh yes

795
00:30:52,679 --> 00:30:55,320
Watson his confession today was as clear

796
00:30:55,320 --> 00:30:59,220
as a bell Tobias organ will hang

797
00:30:59,220 --> 00:31:02,100
as for you my friend I have given you a

798
00:31:02,100 --> 00:31:04,799
terrible time and as a reward I'm going

799
00:31:04,799 --> 00:31:08,520
to take you to the Opera tonight yes

800
00:31:08,520 --> 00:31:11,820
tonight Gilbert and Sullivan the Mercado

801
00:31:11,820 --> 00:31:14,520
but Holmes my memory is you don't much

802
00:31:14,520 --> 00:31:18,240
like Gilbert and Sullivan no Watson but

803
00:31:18,240 --> 00:31:20,700
you do and besides

804
00:31:20,700 --> 00:31:23,039
I have to confess to having a soft spot

805
00:31:23,039 --> 00:31:27,559
for the Lord High executioner

806
00:31:31,060 --> 00:31:34,160
[Music]

807
00:31:36,360 --> 00:31:40,820
the conundrum of coach 13.

808
00:31:42,600 --> 00:31:46,140
on an October morning when rain streamed

809
00:31:46,140 --> 00:31:48,179
from the black clouds that swept above

810
00:31:48,179 --> 00:31:50,220
our Baker Street lodgings

811
00:31:50,220 --> 00:31:52,860
I found my friend Sherlock Holmes in a

812
00:31:52,860 --> 00:31:55,200
similarly overcast mood

813
00:31:55,200 --> 00:31:57,899
he had not had a case in weeks not at

814
00:31:57,899 --> 00:32:00,899
least what he called a decent case and

815
00:32:00,899 --> 00:32:02,640
he had been huffing and puffing about

816
00:32:02,640 --> 00:32:05,039
the house for two days

817
00:32:05,039 --> 00:32:07,679
it was with some relief to both of us

818
00:32:07,679 --> 00:32:09,480
therefore that we heard the slowing

819
00:32:09,480 --> 00:32:11,279
approach of a cab in the street outside

820
00:32:11,279 --> 00:32:14,580
and both moved eagerly to the window the

821
00:32:14,580 --> 00:32:16,679
handsome did indeed stop directly beside

822
00:32:16,679 --> 00:32:19,620
our door and after a moment a large and

823
00:32:19,620 --> 00:32:21,659
finely dressed middle-aged gentleman

824
00:32:21,659 --> 00:32:24,600
emerged into the downpour paid his fare

825
00:32:24,600 --> 00:32:28,559
and rang our doorbell Holmes was smiling

826
00:32:28,559 --> 00:32:31,740
now what could make a rich American so

827
00:32:31,740 --> 00:32:34,200
distressed Watson that he would come

828
00:32:34,200 --> 00:32:37,380
pelmel here to us from Paddington

829
00:32:37,380 --> 00:32:40,740
an American I said drawn irresistibly as

830
00:32:40,740 --> 00:32:43,399
usual into Holmes's tantalizing games

831
00:32:43,399 --> 00:32:45,840
certainly and I think a formidable

832
00:32:45,840 --> 00:32:47,220
character

833
00:32:47,220 --> 00:32:49,980
and you wish to tell me how you deduce

834
00:32:49,980 --> 00:32:51,960
all that homes

835
00:32:51,960 --> 00:32:53,700
I deduce his distress and his

836
00:32:53,700 --> 00:32:55,140
nationality from the fact that he just

837
00:32:55,140 --> 00:32:56,520
tried to pay the cabbie in American

838
00:32:56,520 --> 00:32:58,559
dollars before recalling which pocket

839
00:32:58,559 --> 00:33:01,260
held his Pounds Sterling as for his

840
00:33:01,260 --> 00:33:02,940
coming from Paddington that was the

841
00:33:02,940 --> 00:33:04,919
easiest of all for the driver of the

842
00:33:04,919 --> 00:33:07,440
handsome is Henry Brown I'm surprised

843
00:33:07,440 --> 00:33:09,240
you do not recognize him who always

844
00:33:09,240 --> 00:33:11,700
works from the Paddington rank as ever

845
00:33:11,700 --> 00:33:13,679
Watson I apologize for the banality of

846
00:33:13,679 --> 00:33:16,559
these observations but you did ask

847
00:33:16,559 --> 00:33:18,779
by now there were footsteps on the

848
00:33:18,779 --> 00:33:20,820
stairs as Mrs Hudson escorted the

849
00:33:20,820 --> 00:33:22,740
visitor to our apartment

850
00:33:22,740 --> 00:33:25,140
while I inwardly delighted to note that

851
00:33:25,140 --> 00:33:26,820
my friend had returned to his amiable

852
00:33:26,820 --> 00:33:29,000
best in anticipation of a new challenge

853
00:33:29,000 --> 00:33:32,159
I find myself praying that it would be a

854
00:33:32,159 --> 00:33:34,200
challenge worthy of his powers and his

855
00:33:34,200 --> 00:33:36,059
pent-up Energies

856
00:33:36,059 --> 00:33:38,340
no sooner had the door opened than the

857
00:33:38,340 --> 00:33:40,679
huge returned figure of our visitor

858
00:33:40,679 --> 00:33:43,980
bright in a cream suit burst into the

859
00:33:43,980 --> 00:33:45,779
room like an actor onto a stage

860
00:33:45,779 --> 00:33:47,700
determined to establish his character

861
00:33:47,700 --> 00:33:51,899
instantly Mr Holmes boomed the American

862
00:33:51,899 --> 00:33:54,240
voices both his arms swept forward to

863
00:33:54,240 --> 00:33:57,320
grasp my right hand Benedict Masterson

864
00:33:57,320 --> 00:34:00,600
what a great privilege to meet you

865
00:34:00,600 --> 00:34:04,980
delighted but I am Dr John Watson I

866
00:34:04,980 --> 00:34:09,359
replied this is Mr Sherlock Holmes with

867
00:34:09,359 --> 00:34:11,879
equally booming apologies he bowed

868
00:34:11,879 --> 00:34:14,780
charmingly to me and turned to my friend

869
00:34:14,780 --> 00:34:18,379
ah yes now I see

870
00:34:18,379 --> 00:34:21,899
unmistakable unmistakable

871
00:34:21,899 --> 00:34:23,639
the impression given was that he had

872
00:34:23,639 --> 00:34:25,679
found the first Sherlock Holmes of his

873
00:34:25,679 --> 00:34:27,179
acquaintance a little short of his

874
00:34:27,179 --> 00:34:28,679
expectations

875
00:34:28,679 --> 00:34:32,099
Mr Holmes I wish to ask you to act for

876
00:34:32,099 --> 00:34:34,619
me in a business both mysterious and

877
00:34:34,619 --> 00:34:36,179
distressing

878
00:34:36,179 --> 00:34:38,219
you had better sit down Mr Masterson

879
00:34:38,219 --> 00:34:42,000
said Holmes and tell us everything

880
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:44,399
and having settled his cream-covered

881
00:34:44,399 --> 00:34:46,560
bulk into an armchair and accepted a

882
00:34:46,560 --> 00:34:48,599
cigar on which he continued to Puff

883
00:34:48,599 --> 00:34:51,480
anxiously as he spoke the American told

884
00:34:51,480 --> 00:34:53,040
us his story

885
00:34:53,040 --> 00:34:59,099
I am a dealer in Gold gentlemen gold has

886
00:34:59,099 --> 00:35:00,540
been my life

887
00:35:00,540 --> 00:35:02,940
my father owned small minds in Nevada

888
00:35:02,940 --> 00:35:05,880
which gave us a comfortable living in my

889
00:35:05,880 --> 00:35:08,880
turn through judicious trading I've made

890
00:35:08,880 --> 00:35:12,000
these assets yield a fortune I came to

891
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:13,980
London last week because your own Bank

892
00:35:13,980 --> 00:35:16,020
of England had made an order for a

893
00:35:16,020 --> 00:35:18,540
substantial quantity of gold bars to

894
00:35:18,540 --> 00:35:20,579
boost its Reserves

895
00:35:20,579 --> 00:35:22,859
the bullion was shipped into Bristol

896
00:35:22,859 --> 00:35:26,099
Harbor and transferred yesterday onto a

897
00:35:26,099 --> 00:35:28,500
chartered London train for transfer to

898
00:35:28,500 --> 00:35:29,460
the bank

899
00:35:29,460 --> 00:35:31,619
I have been in London doing the

900
00:35:31,619 --> 00:35:34,500
paperwork of which there is let me

901
00:35:34,500 --> 00:35:37,740
assure you no small amount

902
00:35:37,740 --> 00:35:39,960
and I went to Paddington this morning to

903
00:35:39,960 --> 00:35:42,780
meet the consignment the train was there

904
00:35:42,780 --> 00:35:46,020
the gold was not

905
00:35:46,020 --> 00:35:48,599
I see said Holmes

906
00:35:48,599 --> 00:35:49,880
stolen

907
00:35:49,880 --> 00:35:53,700
undoubtedly how much we're talking four

908
00:35:53,700 --> 00:35:57,599
or five Millions Mr Holmes that's a

909
00:35:57,599 --> 00:36:00,839
large loss is the gold insured indeed it

910
00:36:00,839 --> 00:36:03,000
is but you know insurance companies Mr

911
00:36:03,000 --> 00:36:06,660
Holmes they are ever suspicious and the

912
00:36:06,660 --> 00:36:08,099
circumstances of the Gold's

913
00:36:08,099 --> 00:36:09,960
disappearance are to say the least

914
00:36:09,960 --> 00:36:13,680
rather strange the details Mr Masterson

915
00:36:13,680 --> 00:36:16,440
said my friend if you please

916
00:36:16,440 --> 00:36:19,980
well continued Masterson tapping a thick

917
00:36:19,980 --> 00:36:22,920
cylinder of Ash into the ashtray I had

918
00:36:22,920 --> 00:36:25,020
asked a commission a special an

919
00:36:25,020 --> 00:36:28,140
overnight train and also insisted that

920
00:36:28,140 --> 00:36:32,040
it be discreet not armored or escorted

921
00:36:32,040 --> 00:36:34,680
or in any way having the appearance of a

922
00:36:34,680 --> 00:36:37,500
specially secured conveyance

923
00:36:37,500 --> 00:36:39,960
I was offered the charter of a passenger

924
00:36:39,960 --> 00:36:41,820
train which returns empty from Bristol

925
00:36:41,820 --> 00:36:44,040
to London once a week and which real

926
00:36:44,040 --> 00:36:47,220
women jokingly call the bad luck special

927
00:36:47,220 --> 00:36:49,740
not because anything has ever happened

928
00:36:49,740 --> 00:36:52,140
to it but because it normally consists

929
00:36:52,140 --> 00:36:56,099
of 13 empty passenger coaches as indeed

930
00:36:56,099 --> 00:36:58,020
it did on this occasion

931
00:36:58,020 --> 00:37:01,380
I insisted that the gold be packed in

932
00:37:01,380 --> 00:37:03,960
steel containers each locked with a

933
00:37:03,960 --> 00:37:05,220
unique key

934
00:37:05,220 --> 00:37:07,740
you will appreciate the goal itself

935
00:37:07,740 --> 00:37:10,680
gentlemen is a weighty medal so each box

936
00:37:10,680 --> 00:37:12,960
contained only as many bars as would

937
00:37:12,960 --> 00:37:16,079
enable the containers to be carried in

938
00:37:16,079 --> 00:37:18,300
order to prevent the possibility of them

939
00:37:18,300 --> 00:37:21,480
being removed from the moving train I

940
00:37:21,480 --> 00:37:23,160
ensured that while it was small enough

941
00:37:23,160 --> 00:37:25,140
to go through the open Carriage door

942
00:37:25,140 --> 00:37:28,260
they were too large to pass through the

943
00:37:28,260 --> 00:37:30,660
windows even with the window slid down

944
00:37:30,660 --> 00:37:33,000
to their largest aperture

945
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:34,920
I then arranged for the doors of the

946
00:37:34,920 --> 00:37:36,720
bullion Carriage to be locked from the

947
00:37:36,720 --> 00:37:38,640
outside so they could not be open until

948
00:37:38,640 --> 00:37:41,640
the train reached London the train was

949
00:37:41,640 --> 00:37:43,800
empty then apart from the driver and

950
00:37:43,800 --> 00:37:45,480
farming of the locomotive

951
00:37:45,480 --> 00:37:48,900
no Mr Holmes it is Railway practice for

952
00:37:48,900 --> 00:37:51,720
all trains to have a guard a practice I

953
00:37:51,720 --> 00:37:53,579
was very happy to comply with since it

954
00:37:53,579 --> 00:37:55,320
meant my Consignment would have an

955
00:37:55,320 --> 00:37:57,960
overseer throughout its journey and to

956
00:37:57,960 --> 00:38:00,540
this end all the steel cases were loaded

957
00:38:00,540 --> 00:38:02,940
into the last coach of the train coach

958
00:38:02,940 --> 00:38:06,119
13 where the guard could keep a constant

959
00:38:06,119 --> 00:38:09,060
watch on them the man employed for the

960
00:38:09,060 --> 00:38:14,339
job was a Mr Lions Mr John Lyons a

961
00:38:14,339 --> 00:38:16,079
mature and trusted employee of the

962
00:38:16,079 --> 00:38:17,400
Railway company

963
00:38:17,400 --> 00:38:20,820
here strangely Mr Masterson stopped and

964
00:38:20,820 --> 00:38:25,200
smiled I uh I inquired whether he had

965
00:38:25,200 --> 00:38:28,140
ever worked on the French Railways guard

966
00:38:28,140 --> 00:38:30,240
Lions DC

967
00:38:30,240 --> 00:38:32,880
guard de Leon

968
00:38:32,880 --> 00:38:36,300
Holmes smiled politely and nodded

969
00:38:36,300 --> 00:38:38,220
well forgive me gentlemen I could never

970
00:38:38,220 --> 00:38:41,700
resist upon to continue the train left

971
00:38:41,700 --> 00:38:43,740
Bristol at three this morning as

972
00:38:43,740 --> 00:38:46,020
scheduled but when it arrived at

973
00:38:46,020 --> 00:38:48,300
Paddington at six the steel boxes of

974
00:38:48,300 --> 00:38:50,099
gold were gone

975
00:38:50,099 --> 00:38:54,420
Mr Holmes this was an impossible robbery

976
00:38:54,420 --> 00:38:57,119
the train stopped only once for a minute

977
00:38:57,119 --> 00:39:00,000
or so to take on water hardly time to

978
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:02,280
unload a single box of bullying let

979
00:39:02,280 --> 00:39:04,079
alone a hundred of the darn things

980
00:39:04,079 --> 00:39:07,859
weighing in at 150 pounds apiece

981
00:39:07,859 --> 00:39:11,760
and the god asked Holmes Lions claimed

982
00:39:11,760 --> 00:39:13,440
that he fell asleep somewhere near the

983
00:39:13,440 --> 00:39:15,060
journey awoke to find the bullying

984
00:39:15,060 --> 00:39:17,339
disappeared he's being held a Paddington

985
00:39:17,339 --> 00:39:19,380
along with the driver and engineer but

986
00:39:19,380 --> 00:39:22,680
all ardently protest their innocence and

987
00:39:22,680 --> 00:39:24,960
with regard to other suspects can you

988
00:39:24,960 --> 00:39:26,640
think of anyone in your organization who

989
00:39:26,640 --> 00:39:28,320
might feel inclined to take advantage of

990
00:39:28,320 --> 00:39:31,260
you Masterson pinched his lips and

991
00:39:31,260 --> 00:39:32,640
looked embarrassed

992
00:39:32,640 --> 00:39:34,859
well if I may confide something to you

993
00:39:34,859 --> 00:39:38,940
in the strictest confidence my estranged

994
00:39:38,940 --> 00:39:42,060
wife Laura still has shares in the

995
00:39:42,060 --> 00:39:44,220
company she believes that she should

996
00:39:44,220 --> 00:39:47,579
have more there is uh

997
00:39:47,579 --> 00:39:50,640
some bitterness in this regard however I

998
00:39:50,640 --> 00:39:52,980
know Laura well enough to doubt that she

999
00:39:52,980 --> 00:39:56,339
is a thief my friend simply said Thank

1000
00:39:56,339 --> 00:39:58,560
you Mr Masterson I will certainly take

1001
00:39:58,560 --> 00:39:59,760
the case on

1002
00:39:59,760 --> 00:40:01,740
would you be so good as to why Bristol

1003
00:40:01,740 --> 00:40:03,780
and inform them that Dr Watson and I are

1004
00:40:03,780 --> 00:40:06,900
on our way I will sir you mean to go

1005
00:40:06,900 --> 00:40:07,980
there today

1006
00:40:07,980 --> 00:40:10,440
indeed yes as soon as I have made a

1007
00:40:10,440 --> 00:40:12,599
check or two at Paddington Station

1008
00:40:12,599 --> 00:40:15,480
well I surely thank you I can think of

1009
00:40:15,480 --> 00:40:17,280
no better hands in which to leave the

1010
00:40:17,280 --> 00:40:19,380
case of the bad luck special than those

1011
00:40:19,380 --> 00:40:24,000
of Mr sheer luck Holmes

1012
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:26,760
Holmes did not smile

1013
00:40:26,760 --> 00:40:28,800
I never leave anything to chance Mr

1014
00:40:28,800 --> 00:40:30,020
Masterson

1015
00:40:30,020 --> 00:40:32,640
perspicacity and reason are the tools I

1016
00:40:32,640 --> 00:40:36,780
employ forgive me Mr Holmes as I say I

1017
00:40:36,780 --> 00:40:40,079
am fairly attracted to puns

1018
00:40:40,079 --> 00:40:42,260
we will keep you in touch Holmes said

1019
00:40:42,260 --> 00:40:45,900
with all developments

1020
00:40:45,900 --> 00:40:47,579
within half an hour we were at

1021
00:40:47,579 --> 00:40:49,320
Paddington but before boarding the

1022
00:40:49,320 --> 00:40:50,760
Bristol train Holmes wish to make

1023
00:40:50,760 --> 00:40:52,740
certain that the so-called bad luck

1024
00:40:52,740 --> 00:40:54,780
special was Secure

1025
00:40:54,780 --> 00:40:57,060
the train had been shunted into a siding

1026
00:40:57,060 --> 00:40:58,800
and we were relieved to find the police

1027
00:40:58,800 --> 00:41:00,780
responsibility for the case had fallen

1028
00:41:00,780 --> 00:41:03,900
to inspect a Stanley Hopkins a young but

1029
00:41:03,900 --> 00:41:06,119
ambitious detective with whom Holmes and

1030
00:41:06,119 --> 00:41:08,099
myself had had numerous dealings in the

1031
00:41:08,099 --> 00:41:09,060
past

1032
00:41:09,060 --> 00:41:11,160
hearing that we were being engaged by Mr

1033
00:41:11,160 --> 00:41:13,560
Benedict Masterson the inspector agreed

1034
00:41:13,560 --> 00:41:15,300
to watch over the train and make sure it

1035
00:41:15,300 --> 00:41:17,760
remained undisturbed until our return to

1036
00:41:17,760 --> 00:41:18,720
London

1037
00:41:18,720 --> 00:41:21,180
it was still raining when we arrived at

1038
00:41:21,180 --> 00:41:23,700
Bristol where we met the station Foreman

1039
00:41:23,700 --> 00:41:27,180
George Willits an amiable man in his 50s

1040
00:41:27,180 --> 00:41:29,160
who gave the comforting impression of

1041
00:41:29,160 --> 00:41:30,960
having been in his job for a lifetime

1042
00:41:30,960 --> 00:41:33,060
and knowing the whole business inside

1043
00:41:33,060 --> 00:41:34,020
out

1044
00:41:34,020 --> 00:41:36,060
Willits had been on duty the previous

1045
00:41:36,060 --> 00:41:38,460
night and took us directly to the goods

1046
00:41:38,460 --> 00:41:40,079
platform from which the bullion train

1047
00:41:40,079 --> 00:41:41,220
had left

1048
00:41:41,220 --> 00:41:42,960
though he did his best to be of

1049
00:41:42,960 --> 00:41:46,560
assistance he looked painfully weary

1050
00:41:46,560 --> 00:41:49,560
I apologize you gents for my appearance

1051
00:41:49,560 --> 00:41:51,000
he said

1052
00:41:51,000 --> 00:41:52,800
but I was on night shift last night

1053
00:41:52,800 --> 00:41:54,540
seeing out the special

1054
00:41:54,540 --> 00:41:56,400
was just about to go off when the

1055
00:41:56,400 --> 00:41:58,560
message came from London about the theft

1056
00:41:58,560 --> 00:42:02,339
so I've not yet been on the bed we won't

1057
00:42:02,339 --> 00:42:05,579
keep you long will it Holmes said I

1058
00:42:05,579 --> 00:42:06,900
understand you were here when the

1059
00:42:06,900 --> 00:42:09,720
bullion boxes were being loaded I was

1060
00:42:09,720 --> 00:42:12,720
here he supervised them myself watched

1061
00:42:12,720 --> 00:42:14,339
them being lifted in the guards Carriage

1062
00:42:14,339 --> 00:42:16,740
at this very spot before I sent the

1063
00:42:16,740 --> 00:42:18,480
signal to bring in the rest of the Train

1064
00:42:18,480 --> 00:42:21,060
the guards coach was not connected to

1065
00:42:21,060 --> 00:42:22,859
the train while it was loaded that's

1066
00:42:22,859 --> 00:42:24,720
right sir the rest of the train was

1067
00:42:24,720 --> 00:42:26,460
shutted out of the siding and then

1068
00:42:26,460 --> 00:42:28,380
coupled up just before she would leave

1069
00:42:28,380 --> 00:42:31,800
and who brought her in Tommy Mariette

1070
00:42:31,800 --> 00:42:33,359
the engineer in his farm and Pat

1071
00:42:33,359 --> 00:42:37,260
mcglinchey old hands not quite so much a

1072
00:42:37,260 --> 00:42:39,300
fixture as myself Mr romes but they've

1073
00:42:39,300 --> 00:42:41,040
been around the best part of 10 years

1074
00:42:41,040 --> 00:42:43,140
they're sound men

1075
00:42:43,140 --> 00:42:44,220
good

1076
00:42:44,220 --> 00:42:45,720
now if you'll bear with me a little

1077
00:42:45,720 --> 00:42:47,339
longer will it I'd like to ask you a

1078
00:42:47,339 --> 00:42:49,740
little more about the gold itself how

1079
00:42:49,740 --> 00:42:51,599
many men were involved in loading the

1080
00:42:51,599 --> 00:42:52,680
carriage

1081
00:42:52,680 --> 00:42:55,260
well sir it was quite some operation

1082
00:42:55,260 --> 00:42:57,780
took four men to load each box two

1083
00:42:57,780 --> 00:43:00,359
inside the carriage two outside damn

1084
00:43:00,359 --> 00:43:02,400
heavy things if you'll excuse me sir

1085
00:43:02,400 --> 00:43:04,619
over a hundred weight a piece and damn

1086
00:43:04,619 --> 00:43:06,119
awkward squeezing him through them

1087
00:43:06,119 --> 00:43:08,940
narrow doors it was out of a job and how

1088
00:43:08,940 --> 00:43:10,020
long would you say the whole business

1089
00:43:10,020 --> 00:43:12,420
took it was about half past midnight

1090
00:43:12,420 --> 00:43:13,980
when they started in about a quarter

1091
00:43:13,980 --> 00:43:16,680
before two by the time they finished so

1092
00:43:16,680 --> 00:43:19,680
almost 80 minutes and after it was

1093
00:43:19,680 --> 00:43:21,599
loaded was there any delay before

1094
00:43:21,599 --> 00:43:23,940
departure no sir the rest of the train

1095
00:43:23,940 --> 00:43:25,980
as I say was reversed in from the soil

1096
00:43:25,980 --> 00:43:29,160
John Lyons the guard got aboard and the

1097
00:43:29,160 --> 00:43:30,720
door of the guards coach was locked from

1098
00:43:30,720 --> 00:43:33,720
without sir as per our instructions one

1099
00:43:33,720 --> 00:43:36,240
final question will it's if I may I'm

1100
00:43:36,240 --> 00:43:38,880
informed the train stopped on Route yes

1101
00:43:38,880 --> 00:43:40,680
sir she was scheduled to hold up for a

1102
00:43:40,680 --> 00:43:42,599
minute or so at Swindon to take on water

1103
00:43:42,599 --> 00:43:45,060
it stopped for no longer than that and

1104
00:43:45,060 --> 00:43:48,359
at no other time no sir the signalman

1105
00:43:48,359 --> 00:43:49,740
would know for sure she'd been held over

1106
00:43:49,740 --> 00:43:51,000
for more than a minute and that's

1107
00:43:51,000 --> 00:43:52,800
already been checked

1108
00:43:52,800 --> 00:43:55,260
Holmes seemed to pause for a moment

1109
00:43:55,260 --> 00:43:57,440
while he considered all this information

1110
00:43:57,440 --> 00:43:59,460
and then he said

1111
00:43:59,460 --> 00:44:01,079
well it's I'm most grateful for your

1112
00:44:01,079 --> 00:44:03,180
detailed and I have no doubt accurate

1113
00:44:03,180 --> 00:44:05,819
Recollections now if you will excuse us

1114
00:44:05,819 --> 00:44:08,099
Dr Watson and I will take the next train

1115
00:44:08,099 --> 00:44:10,560
back to London and leave you to go home

1116
00:44:10,560 --> 00:44:13,520
and get some sleep

1117
00:44:13,920 --> 00:44:16,440
inspector Hopkins was at Paddington when

1118
00:44:16,440 --> 00:44:18,540
we arrived and Holmes immediately

1119
00:44:18,540 --> 00:44:20,579
requested that he arranged for us to

1120
00:44:20,579 --> 00:44:22,260
speak to the railway man who had

1121
00:44:22,260 --> 00:44:24,420
commandeered the bad luck special on the

1122
00:44:24,420 --> 00:44:26,579
previous night Marriott and mcglinchey

1123
00:44:26,579 --> 00:44:28,859
the engineer and farman and the guard

1124
00:44:28,859 --> 00:44:30,540
lions

1125
00:44:30,540 --> 00:44:33,240
in a dark Office of the Railway men's

1126
00:44:33,240 --> 00:44:35,940
Quarters on one of the Grimmer outer

1127
00:44:35,940 --> 00:44:38,280
platforms of Paddington Station the

1128
00:44:38,280 --> 00:44:41,460
three men sat disconsolately on rickety

1129
00:44:41,460 --> 00:44:43,980
wooden chairs it occurred to me that

1130
00:44:43,980 --> 00:44:46,200
they had by now been detained in this

1131
00:44:46,200 --> 00:44:48,839
dismal place for several hours

1132
00:44:48,839 --> 00:44:51,240
and when Holmes and I were introduced to

1133
00:44:51,240 --> 00:44:53,819
Lions he barely had the energy to nod to

1134
00:44:53,819 --> 00:44:55,980
us but he did speak

1135
00:44:55,980 --> 00:44:58,740
his words almost drowned in the muffler

1136
00:44:58,740 --> 00:45:01,140
which half covered his mouth

1137
00:45:01,140 --> 00:45:03,900
I dare say you think me a thief Mr Rose

1138
00:45:03,900 --> 00:45:06,359
from what you'll have heard

1139
00:45:06,359 --> 00:45:08,220
I'm not sir

1140
00:45:08,220 --> 00:45:11,099
but what I have done is derelict my duty

1141
00:45:11,099 --> 00:45:14,640
so maybe I deserve what's coming I want

1142
00:45:14,640 --> 00:45:17,640
to assure you Mr Lions Holmes said that

1143
00:45:17,640 --> 00:45:19,440
my intention here is to uncover the

1144
00:45:19,440 --> 00:45:22,319
truth and uncover it I will if you are

1145
00:45:22,319 --> 00:45:24,540
as you say innocent of any crime you

1146
00:45:24,540 --> 00:45:26,640
have nothing to fear from the law but

1147
00:45:26,640 --> 00:45:28,440
tell me how you think you failed in your

1148
00:45:28,440 --> 00:45:30,780
duty what I Were Meant to keep me high

1149
00:45:30,780 --> 00:45:33,000
on the shipment sir weren't I I fell

1150
00:45:33,000 --> 00:45:35,040
asleep it's not something I make a habit

1151
00:45:35,040 --> 00:45:37,859
of but this time I did and woke to find

1152
00:45:37,859 --> 00:45:41,460
the bullion gone a nightmare sir I

1153
00:45:41,460 --> 00:45:42,720
suppose I should have stopped the train

1154
00:45:42,720 --> 00:45:44,579
with a pool call but I was in a bit of a

1155
00:45:44,579 --> 00:45:45,720
daze

1156
00:45:45,720 --> 00:45:48,060
how long do you think you slept I

1157
00:45:48,060 --> 00:45:50,339
thought about that sir I remember us

1158
00:45:50,339 --> 00:45:52,140
passing through the White Horse Valley

1159
00:45:52,140 --> 00:45:55,140
just before Swindon and when I woke up

1160
00:45:55,140 --> 00:45:57,480
we were about 10 miles out of it and

1161
00:45:57,480 --> 00:46:00,180
passed the lamsy water tower Holmes

1162
00:46:00,180 --> 00:46:03,060
looked towards the fireman mcglinchey a

1163
00:46:03,060 --> 00:46:06,599
plump man with Rich black curls when you

1164
00:46:06,599 --> 00:46:08,160
stop to fill the tank did you notice

1165
00:46:08,160 --> 00:46:11,339
anything odd no sir it was a dark night

1166
00:46:11,339 --> 00:46:13,380
and there were no lights there save the

1167
00:46:13,380 --> 00:46:15,359
fires from the boiler you couldn't see

1168
00:46:15,359 --> 00:46:17,700
20 feet beyond the train

1169
00:46:17,700 --> 00:46:20,520
homes turned back to Lions I would like

1170
00:46:20,520 --> 00:46:22,020
you to describe to me the events of

1171
00:46:22,020 --> 00:46:25,140
yesterday evening well sir oh I wasn't

1172
00:46:25,140 --> 00:46:26,880
you starting my shift until one in the

1173
00:46:26,880 --> 00:46:28,740
morning so around about 12 I had a brown

1174
00:46:28,740 --> 00:46:30,780
ale in the railway mince can eat and

1175
00:46:30,780 --> 00:46:32,520
collected some sandwiches and a can of

1176
00:46:32,520 --> 00:46:34,920
tea for the journey just tea and

1177
00:46:34,920 --> 00:46:38,099
sandwiches yes sir and a piece of seed

1178
00:46:38,099 --> 00:46:41,700
cake if that's not too much detail

1179
00:46:41,700 --> 00:46:44,099
there is no such thing as too much

1180
00:46:44,099 --> 00:46:47,220
detail please continue with your story

1181
00:46:47,220 --> 00:46:49,619
well at about half past one I made my

1182
00:46:49,619 --> 00:46:52,079
way over to the goods platform they just

1183
00:46:52,079 --> 00:46:53,520
finished loading the bullion into the

1184
00:46:53,520 --> 00:46:55,140
end carriage and the other part the

1185
00:46:55,140 --> 00:46:57,420
train had been brought in and coupled up

1186
00:46:57,420 --> 00:46:59,579
a gentleman in his suit gave us final

1187
00:46:59,579 --> 00:47:01,920
instructions to the engineering farm and

1188
00:47:01,920 --> 00:47:03,960
Tommy and Pat here he said the train was

1189
00:47:03,960 --> 00:47:06,060
cleared to London with just the one

1190
00:47:06,060 --> 00:47:08,040
brief water stop which was under no

1191
00:47:08,040 --> 00:47:10,140
circumstances to take more than three

1192
00:47:10,140 --> 00:47:11,819
minutes and if there should be an

1193
00:47:11,819 --> 00:47:14,280
emergency they won't leave the cab

1194
00:47:14,280 --> 00:47:16,260
at that point they locked me in with the

1195
00:47:16,260 --> 00:47:19,380
gold and at exactly 2 A.M we were on our

1196
00:47:19,380 --> 00:47:20,160
way

1197
00:47:20,160 --> 00:47:22,619
about a half hour after I had me

1198
00:47:22,619 --> 00:47:25,079
sandwiches and a few swigs of tea it

1199
00:47:25,079 --> 00:47:26,760
were a clear night and I sat by one of

1200
00:47:26,760 --> 00:47:28,200
the windows and watched the Stars

1201
00:47:28,200 --> 00:47:30,780
contented with everything sir that's

1202
00:47:30,780 --> 00:47:33,960
when I must have dozed and well what

1203
00:47:33,960 --> 00:47:36,780
happened after that you know

1204
00:47:36,780 --> 00:47:38,339
thank you lions

1205
00:47:38,339 --> 00:47:40,619
said Holmes then he turned to Young

1206
00:47:40,619 --> 00:47:42,839
inspector Hopkins with a new Fierce

1207
00:47:42,839 --> 00:47:46,020
gleam in his eye if we may Hopkins I

1208
00:47:46,020 --> 00:47:49,020
should now like to inspect the train

1209
00:47:49,020 --> 00:47:51,480
we made our way along the track to the

1210
00:47:51,480 --> 00:47:53,220
engine sheds and after checking the

1211
00:47:53,220 --> 00:47:55,440
locomotive searched through each of the

1212
00:47:55,440 --> 00:47:57,780
13 coaches whose number I carefully

1213
00:47:57,780 --> 00:48:00,540
counted myself until we arrived at the

1214
00:48:00,540 --> 00:48:03,180
last the guards coach in which the gold

1215
00:48:03,180 --> 00:48:05,460
had been transported

1216
00:48:05,460 --> 00:48:08,220
now I have been assured Holmes said to

1217
00:48:08,220 --> 00:48:10,200
Hopkins that the doors of this coach

1218
00:48:10,200 --> 00:48:11,940
were locked from the outside for the

1219
00:48:11,940 --> 00:48:14,160
duration of the journey

1220
00:48:14,160 --> 00:48:16,200
yes Mr ohms

1221
00:48:16,200 --> 00:48:18,119
yet it was possible to move along the

1222
00:48:18,119 --> 00:48:19,500
train through the coaches via the

1223
00:48:19,500 --> 00:48:22,440
connecting doors yes and what are the

1224
00:48:22,440 --> 00:48:23,760
other coaches

1225
00:48:23,760 --> 00:48:26,099
I checked them that outer doors were all

1226
00:48:26,099 --> 00:48:27,540
locked too but it would have been

1227
00:48:27,540 --> 00:48:29,099
impossible anyway for the thieves to

1228
00:48:29,099 --> 00:48:30,359
have moved the containers along the

1229
00:48:30,359 --> 00:48:31,800
train to Jefferson them from another

1230
00:48:31,800 --> 00:48:34,020
Carriage the boxes of gold were too big

1231
00:48:34,020 --> 00:48:36,359
to pass through the connecting doors all

1232
00:48:36,359 --> 00:48:38,700
that had been carefully calculated

1233
00:48:38,700 --> 00:48:41,160
but is it quite certain I ventured that

1234
00:48:41,160 --> 00:48:43,200
the boxes could not have been opened and

1235
00:48:43,200 --> 00:48:46,140
the gold removed bar by bar quite

1236
00:48:46,140 --> 00:48:48,900
certain said Hopkins not without the

1237
00:48:48,900 --> 00:48:51,540
original keys they were unique to each

1238
00:48:51,540 --> 00:48:52,920
box

1239
00:48:52,920 --> 00:48:55,560
besides Watson said Holmes if the boxes

1240
00:48:55,560 --> 00:48:57,240
had been opened here then with or

1241
00:48:57,240 --> 00:48:59,220
without the gold they would still surely

1242
00:48:59,220 --> 00:49:00,720
be here now

1243
00:49:00,720 --> 00:49:03,240
speaking of which Hopkins The Carriage

1244
00:49:03,240 --> 00:49:05,460
is just as it was found when the doors

1245
00:49:05,460 --> 00:49:07,500
were first opened this morning as I said

1246
00:49:07,500 --> 00:49:09,960
Mr ohms nothing's been touched

1247
00:49:09,960 --> 00:49:12,240
Holmes took an initial sweeping glass

1248
00:49:12,240 --> 00:49:14,280
around the carriage interior then

1249
00:49:14,280 --> 00:49:16,200
stooped to pick something up from the

1250
00:49:16,200 --> 00:49:16,920
floor

1251
00:49:16,920 --> 00:49:19,680
this brown paper I presume the wrapping

1252
00:49:19,680 --> 00:49:22,680
for the guard Lion's sandwiches

1253
00:49:22,680 --> 00:49:26,339
yes this is can of tea yes

1254
00:49:26,339 --> 00:49:30,540
curious that he had a can of tea

1255
00:49:30,540 --> 00:49:32,099
no no

1256
00:49:32,099 --> 00:49:34,680
curious that a man under stress should

1257
00:49:34,680 --> 00:49:37,560
be so painstakingly tidy I don't

1258
00:49:37,560 --> 00:49:38,940
understand sir

1259
00:49:38,940 --> 00:49:41,160
never mind what do you make of this

1260
00:49:41,160 --> 00:49:42,359
Hopkins

1261
00:49:42,359 --> 00:49:45,420
homes had picked up from the corner a

1262
00:49:45,420 --> 00:49:48,300
loop of scarlet fabric silken and

1263
00:49:48,300 --> 00:49:49,619
ruffled

1264
00:49:49,619 --> 00:49:52,980
I don't know Mr domes I was completely

1265
00:49:52,980 --> 00:49:55,680
baffled by it it seems to be a small

1266
00:49:55,680 --> 00:49:57,660
decorative item of some sort from a

1267
00:49:57,660 --> 00:49:59,520
lady's wardrobe

1268
00:49:59,520 --> 00:50:03,359
a hair tie I should think I said how

1269
00:50:03,359 --> 00:50:05,280
might it have got here

1270
00:50:05,280 --> 00:50:08,040
I don't know doctor I'm sure but I

1271
00:50:08,040 --> 00:50:09,780
suppose it's theoretically possible that

1272
00:50:09,780 --> 00:50:11,880
someone might have concealed herself in

1273
00:50:11,880 --> 00:50:13,560
another carriage

1274
00:50:13,560 --> 00:50:16,500
Holmes had put the object to his nose

1275
00:50:16,500 --> 00:50:19,619
that is a perfume to it he said but

1276
00:50:19,619 --> 00:50:22,319
faint as though it had not been worn for

1277
00:50:22,319 --> 00:50:23,880
some time

1278
00:50:23,880 --> 00:50:27,660
could it belong to the thief I asked

1279
00:50:27,660 --> 00:50:31,079
tentatively possibly said Holmes though

1280
00:50:31,079 --> 00:50:33,480
I think that might have been a thief too

1281
00:50:33,480 --> 00:50:34,260
many

1282
00:50:34,260 --> 00:50:36,780
he stooped to replace the Scarlet fabric

1283
00:50:36,780 --> 00:50:38,460
on the floor of the carriage

1284
00:50:38,460 --> 00:50:40,619
I think we are close to a conclusion

1285
00:50:40,619 --> 00:50:42,720
Watson

1286
00:50:42,720 --> 00:50:44,760
Hopkins I should like to talk to the

1287
00:50:44,760 --> 00:50:46,859
guard lands again and to the driver and

1288
00:50:46,859 --> 00:50:49,020
his fireman please make sure that there

1289
00:50:49,020 --> 00:50:50,700
is at least one other police officer

1290
00:50:50,700 --> 00:50:53,099
present and we must be sure to invite Mr

1291
00:50:53,099 --> 00:50:55,800
Benedict Masterson to our little denumor

1292
00:50:55,800 --> 00:50:58,260
since she's been kind enough to pay the

1293
00:50:58,260 --> 00:51:00,960
fee for this investigation

1294
00:51:00,960 --> 00:51:03,420
by the time Masterson arrived the Clock

1295
00:51:03,420 --> 00:51:05,460
Was approaching nine and we sat in the

1296
00:51:05,460 --> 00:51:08,160
old mess room bathed in dingy yellow

1297
00:51:08,160 --> 00:51:11,640
Gaslight the rain rattled ceaselessly on

1298
00:51:11,640 --> 00:51:13,859
the roof and windows and when we were

1299
00:51:13,859 --> 00:51:16,800
all assembled the three weary railwaymen

1300
00:51:16,800 --> 00:51:19,440
along with Benedict Masterson inspector

1301
00:51:19,440 --> 00:51:22,319
Hopkins a junior officer and Holmes and

1302
00:51:22,319 --> 00:51:23,520
myself

1303
00:51:23,520 --> 00:51:26,520
the Gathering became hushed and

1304
00:51:26,520 --> 00:51:27,900
expectant

1305
00:51:27,900 --> 00:51:29,819
Masterson said

1306
00:51:29,819 --> 00:51:32,520
well this has certainly been a baffling

1307
00:51:32,520 --> 00:51:35,040
business Mr Holmes but I assume we're

1308
00:51:35,040 --> 00:51:36,720
here because you've picked up some Clues

1309
00:51:36,720 --> 00:51:38,220
along the way

1310
00:51:38,220 --> 00:51:40,680
you are certainly a man equal to his

1311
00:51:40,680 --> 00:51:42,180
reputation sir

1312
00:51:42,180 --> 00:51:44,640
the inspector mentioned a red silk

1313
00:51:44,640 --> 00:51:46,740
trinket of some sort

1314
00:51:46,740 --> 00:51:50,099
yes Holmes said he produced the item

1315
00:51:50,099 --> 00:51:52,740
from his pocket this piece of perfumed

1316
00:51:52,740 --> 00:51:53,700
fabric

1317
00:51:53,700 --> 00:51:55,920
the clear message is that someone was

1318
00:51:55,920 --> 00:51:57,660
concealed in the carriage with the

1319
00:51:57,660 --> 00:51:58,680
bullion

1320
00:51:58,680 --> 00:52:02,520
I see and moreover I put in that the

1321
00:52:02,520 --> 00:52:05,400
concealed person was probably female

1322
00:52:05,400 --> 00:52:08,880
Masterson appeared a little shaken

1323
00:52:08,880 --> 00:52:11,099
female you say

1324
00:52:11,099 --> 00:52:12,839
oh dear

1325
00:52:12,839 --> 00:52:16,740
if I may said Holmes we will return to

1326
00:52:16,740 --> 00:52:20,280
that later Mr Lyons let us revert for

1327
00:52:20,280 --> 00:52:22,319
the present to the subject of your

1328
00:52:22,319 --> 00:52:25,980
sandwiches my sandwiches again sir

1329
00:52:25,980 --> 00:52:27,300
indeed

1330
00:52:27,300 --> 00:52:29,760
the sandwiches you took on board the

1331
00:52:29,760 --> 00:52:31,559
train last night together with the seed

1332
00:52:31,559 --> 00:52:33,720
cake in the can of cold tea

1333
00:52:33,720 --> 00:52:35,640
you say you at them just before you fell

1334
00:52:35,640 --> 00:52:37,740
asleep yes sir

1335
00:52:37,740 --> 00:52:40,319
you ate the sandwiches and the cake you

1336
00:52:40,319 --> 00:52:42,780
dozed off you woke up again and the gold

1337
00:52:42,780 --> 00:52:43,980
was gone

1338
00:52:43,980 --> 00:52:45,300
yes sir

1339
00:52:45,300 --> 00:52:47,160
that's how it happened

1340
00:52:47,160 --> 00:52:48,780
and when you came around and realized

1341
00:52:48,780 --> 00:52:51,420
the gold had gone you say it was like a

1342
00:52:51,420 --> 00:52:54,900
nightmare yes Mr Rose you were very

1343
00:52:54,900 --> 00:52:58,559
agitated I certainly was too agitated I

1344
00:52:58,559 --> 00:53:00,599
expect to sweep the floor of the

1345
00:53:00,599 --> 00:53:04,020
carriage to what sir I presume you did

1346
00:53:04,020 --> 00:53:06,300
not sweep the floor of the carriage at

1347
00:53:06,300 --> 00:53:08,700
that point in that Disturbed state

1348
00:53:08,700 --> 00:53:12,119
no sir I didn't with respect sir that's

1349
00:53:12,119 --> 00:53:14,880
not my job quite I wouldn't expect you

1350
00:53:14,880 --> 00:53:16,800
to which makes it very difficult to

1351
00:53:16,800 --> 00:53:19,079
explain why when I examined the guards

1352
00:53:19,079 --> 00:53:20,880
coach this afternoon I found not a

1353
00:53:20,880 --> 00:53:23,700
single crumb on the floor Now can anyone

1354
00:53:23,700 --> 00:53:25,440
here tell me how it's possible to eat

1355
00:53:25,440 --> 00:53:27,780
several sandwiches and a slice of seed

1356
00:53:27,780 --> 00:53:31,200
cake without dropping a single crumb or

1357
00:53:31,200 --> 00:53:33,599
come to that A Single Seed

1358
00:53:33,599 --> 00:53:35,880
I promise you sir what I said about my

1359
00:53:35,880 --> 00:53:38,460
supper was true I remember exactly what

1360
00:53:38,460 --> 00:53:41,220
I brought and exactly what I ate I have

1361
00:53:41,220 --> 00:53:44,880
no doubt of that Mr Lions then what sir

1362
00:53:44,880 --> 00:53:46,920
my point is merely that you were

1363
00:53:46,920 --> 00:53:50,400
obviously not in coach 13 when you ate

1364
00:53:50,400 --> 00:53:52,200
the sandwiches

1365
00:53:52,200 --> 00:53:55,800
On My Honor Mr Owens I swear I was oh

1366
00:53:55,800 --> 00:53:57,900
you weren't in a cannon certainly but

1367
00:53:57,900 --> 00:53:59,220
you were not in the carriage in which

1368
00:53:59,220 --> 00:54:01,200
your sandwich wrapper was found

1369
00:54:01,200 --> 00:54:04,260
the coach where you ate your supper the

1370
00:54:04,260 --> 00:54:05,760
coach with the bullion

1371
00:54:05,760 --> 00:54:08,819
never made it to London

1372
00:54:08,819 --> 00:54:10,680
Mr Holmes

1373
00:54:10,680 --> 00:54:15,540
this is confusing began Masterson homes

1374
00:54:15,540 --> 00:54:18,119
interrupted on the contrary Mr Masterson

1375
00:54:18,119 --> 00:54:20,819
it's very clear the coach containing the

1376
00:54:20,819 --> 00:54:22,800
gold was uncoupled from the train when

1377
00:54:22,800 --> 00:54:25,260
it stopped for water run into a sighting

1378
00:54:25,260 --> 00:54:27,240
by those awaiting it and unloaded of its

1379
00:54:27,240 --> 00:54:29,160
cargo at their Leisure during the night

1380
00:54:29,160 --> 00:54:31,980
it was a perfectly dark night there was

1381
00:54:31,980 --> 00:54:34,920
no moon so the railway men as Mr

1382
00:54:34,920 --> 00:54:37,380
mcglinchey here has recently confirmed

1383
00:54:37,380 --> 00:54:39,900
could from the water pump see nothing of

1384
00:54:39,900 --> 00:54:41,819
what was going on at the back of the

1385
00:54:41,819 --> 00:54:42,780
train

1386
00:54:42,780 --> 00:54:46,079
but Mr Holmes said inspector Hopkins the

1387
00:54:46,079 --> 00:54:49,200
bad luck special has 13 coaches everyone

1388
00:54:49,200 --> 00:54:51,300
knows that and you will no doubt

1389
00:54:51,300 --> 00:54:52,559
yourself and noted that we passed

1390
00:54:52,559 --> 00:54:54,599
through exactly 13 coaches in our

1391
00:54:54,599 --> 00:54:56,880
inspection of the train this afternoon

1392
00:54:56,880 --> 00:54:59,400
oh it has 13 coaches now of course

1393
00:54:59,400 --> 00:55:01,859
inspector Holmes said

1394
00:55:01,859 --> 00:55:03,960
and it only struck me after we had left

1395
00:55:03,960 --> 00:55:06,059
Bristol and its pleasant station Master

1396
00:55:06,059 --> 00:55:08,400
Willits that he had described to us in

1397
00:55:08,400 --> 00:55:10,140
detail his whole engagement with the

1398
00:55:10,140 --> 00:55:12,180
loading of the gold and the departure of

1399
00:55:12,180 --> 00:55:13,980
the train without once mentioning that

1400
00:55:13,980 --> 00:55:16,020
he'd counted the coaches before the

1401
00:55:16,020 --> 00:55:17,579
train left

1402
00:55:17,579 --> 00:55:21,000
the fact is he didn't count them he

1403
00:55:21,000 --> 00:55:23,099
didn't think he needed to the bad luck

1404
00:55:23,099 --> 00:55:25,140
special had always consisted of 13

1405
00:55:25,140 --> 00:55:27,720
coaches he wasn't to know that your

1406
00:55:27,720 --> 00:55:30,240
accomplices at Bristol had added an

1407
00:55:30,240 --> 00:55:32,460
additional coach to the train before it

1408
00:55:32,460 --> 00:55:34,559
was attached to the coach carrying the

1409
00:55:34,559 --> 00:55:37,619
boxes a coach with its seats stripped

1410
00:55:37,619 --> 00:55:40,140
out to make it practically identical to

1411
00:55:40,140 --> 00:55:41,760
the bullion car

1412
00:55:41,760 --> 00:55:44,339
on that one night the bad luck special

1413
00:55:44,339 --> 00:55:48,599
had not 13 but 14 carriages

1414
00:55:48,599 --> 00:55:50,579
when the train stopped to acquire water

1415
00:55:50,579 --> 00:55:54,119
it simultaneously shed a coach and it

1416
00:55:54,119 --> 00:55:56,700
very nearly he continued turning back to

1417
00:55:56,700 --> 00:55:59,880
Lions shared a guard too

1418
00:55:59,880 --> 00:56:03,119
you're a very fortunate man lions

1419
00:56:03,119 --> 00:56:05,880
I don't feel fortunate sir

1420
00:56:05,880 --> 00:56:08,160
your good fortune is that you are still

1421
00:56:08,160 --> 00:56:10,740
alive and that in turn is because you

1422
00:56:10,740 --> 00:56:13,260
are fortunate enough to fall asleep

1423
00:56:13,260 --> 00:56:16,559
imagine if you had not the train stops

1424
00:56:16,559 --> 00:56:18,599
the thieves uncouple the rear coach with

1425
00:56:18,599 --> 00:56:20,460
yourself inside it as soon as you see

1426
00:56:20,460 --> 00:56:22,440
them you become a risk to them there's

1427
00:56:22,440 --> 00:56:24,240
no telling what they might have done

1428
00:56:24,240 --> 00:56:26,339
what I believe actually happened was

1429
00:56:26,339 --> 00:56:27,960
that as they were releasing The Carriage

1430
00:56:27,960 --> 00:56:29,940
from the train someone noticed that you

1431
00:56:29,940 --> 00:56:32,099
were asleep inside they took the

1432
00:56:32,099 --> 00:56:33,599
opportunity to move you into the next

1433
00:56:33,599 --> 00:56:35,819
coach along with your tea can and

1434
00:56:35,819 --> 00:56:37,500
sandwich wrappings

1435
00:56:37,500 --> 00:56:39,839
you may be thankful you did not wake at

1436
00:56:39,839 --> 00:56:41,760
that moment

1437
00:56:41,760 --> 00:56:47,119
Masterson War an expression of amazement

1438
00:56:47,119 --> 00:56:52,980
I am full of admiration Mr Holmes

1439
00:56:52,980 --> 00:56:56,280
but at the same time I feel somewhat

1440
00:56:56,280 --> 00:56:57,839
desolated

1441
00:56:57,839 --> 00:57:00,300
this clearly means that someone in my

1442
00:57:00,300 --> 00:57:03,180
organization has betrayed me

1443
00:57:03,180 --> 00:57:05,339
which brings me back to the Ring of

1444
00:57:05,339 --> 00:57:07,319
scarlet silk discovered in the cottage

1445
00:57:07,319 --> 00:57:10,079
certainly an intriguing adornment to the

1446
00:57:10,079 --> 00:57:12,119
problem said Holmes

1447
00:57:12,119 --> 00:57:14,940
it could indeed signify the presence of

1448
00:57:14,940 --> 00:57:16,140
a woman

1449
00:57:16,140 --> 00:57:18,540
but there is the mystery I said of how

1450
00:57:18,540 --> 00:57:20,040
she got there or what she might have

1451
00:57:20,040 --> 00:57:21,119
done

1452
00:57:21,119 --> 00:57:24,660
I think however said Holmes that is a

1453
00:57:24,660 --> 00:57:27,240
mystery with a simple solution

1454
00:57:27,240 --> 00:57:29,700
at this point Masterson appeared rather

1455
00:57:29,700 --> 00:57:32,819
tragically stricken you're thinking

1456
00:57:32,819 --> 00:57:37,940
yes said Holmes you're thinking that my

1457
00:57:37,940 --> 00:57:40,859
estranged wife Laura

1458
00:57:40,859 --> 00:57:44,760
dear God that foolish woman oh come

1459
00:57:44,760 --> 00:57:47,040
along Mr Masterson you know full well

1460
00:57:47,040 --> 00:57:48,540
your wife had nothing to do with it

1461
00:57:48,540 --> 00:57:50,700
there was no one aboard the train saved

1462
00:57:50,700 --> 00:57:52,740
the three men here driver engineer and

1463
00:57:52,740 --> 00:57:54,059
guard and none of them had anything to

1464
00:57:54,059 --> 00:57:55,619
do with the robbery

1465
00:57:55,619 --> 00:57:57,480
the three railwaymen looked at one

1466
00:57:57,480 --> 00:57:58,980
another as though they had suddenly had

1467
00:57:58,980 --> 00:58:00,780
revealed to them their entitlement to a

1468
00:58:00,780 --> 00:58:02,280
joint Fortune

1469
00:58:02,280 --> 00:58:05,760
as for the thieves said Holmes they are

1470
00:58:05,760 --> 00:58:08,040
to be located somewhere nursing a horde

1471
00:58:08,040 --> 00:58:09,720
of bullying a part of course from their

1472
00:58:09,720 --> 00:58:13,740
paymaster who is sitting here with us

1473
00:58:13,740 --> 00:58:16,980
is that not so Mr Masterson

1474
00:58:16,980 --> 00:58:20,640
Masterson blasted and steamed he was

1475
00:58:20,640 --> 00:58:23,460
outraged this was absurd

1476
00:58:23,460 --> 00:58:27,180
how dare you sir what evidence have you

1477
00:58:27,180 --> 00:58:29,880
for such an outrageous suggestion I had

1478
00:58:29,880 --> 00:58:31,920
misgivings from the beginning I could

1479
00:58:31,920 --> 00:58:33,599
not understand why you came to me so

1480
00:58:33,599 --> 00:58:35,099
quickly after the theft had been

1481
00:58:35,099 --> 00:58:37,140
discovered when you had so much else to

1482
00:58:37,140 --> 00:58:38,099
deal with

1483
00:58:38,099 --> 00:58:40,500
I see now that you were pains to

1484
00:58:40,500 --> 00:58:41,940
demonstrate to the insurance company

1485
00:58:41,940 --> 00:58:44,099
that you were doing all in your power to

1486
00:58:44,099 --> 00:58:46,740
recover the bullion because of course if

1487
00:58:46,740 --> 00:58:49,020
you could have both the gold and the

1488
00:58:49,020 --> 00:58:50,940
insurance money you would have

1489
00:58:50,940 --> 00:58:54,059
considerably augmented your fortune

1490
00:58:54,059 --> 00:58:55,500
but worse still

1491
00:58:55,500 --> 00:58:57,299
what your partners in crime would have

1492
00:58:57,299 --> 00:59:00,180
done to Mr Lions had he not had the good

1493
00:59:00,180 --> 00:59:02,400
sense to fall asleep on the job hardly

1494
00:59:02,400 --> 00:59:04,020
Bears thinking about

1495
00:59:04,020 --> 00:59:07,799
you were prepared not just to steal but

1496
00:59:07,799 --> 00:59:11,280
to be an accessory to murder this is

1497
00:59:11,280 --> 00:59:13,380
speculation Mr Holmes this would not

1498
00:59:13,380 --> 00:59:15,480
stand up in court you should be looking

1499
00:59:15,480 --> 00:59:18,359
for another felon what about that red

1500
00:59:18,359 --> 00:59:20,579
silk ring ah yes

1501
00:59:20,579 --> 00:59:22,260
you've been very subtle about that Mr

1502
00:59:22,260 --> 00:59:23,339
Masterson

1503
00:59:23,339 --> 00:59:25,500
suggesting your wife's name one moment

1504
00:59:25,500 --> 00:59:27,599
and the next assuring me that she could

1505
00:59:27,599 --> 00:59:29,940
not possibly be implicated

1506
00:59:29,940 --> 00:59:31,680
I doubt whether you thought she would be

1507
00:59:31,680 --> 00:59:33,839
but you certainly sought to throw me off

1508
00:59:33,839 --> 00:59:35,040
the scent

1509
00:59:35,040 --> 00:59:37,799
what was that item if not a red herring

1510
00:59:37,799 --> 00:59:40,380
and is that not for those who like to

1511
00:59:40,380 --> 00:59:43,020
play games with words another way to say

1512
00:59:43,020 --> 00:59:45,839
a red heading

1513
00:59:45,839 --> 00:59:47,880
what fun you no doubt plan to have with

1514
00:59:47,880 --> 00:59:50,339
that joke Mr Masterson had you got away

1515
00:59:50,339 --> 00:59:51,780
with this business

1516
00:59:51,780 --> 00:59:55,079
now it seems The Joke is on You

1517
00:59:55,079 --> 00:59:58,799
that was one pun Mr Masterson

1518
00:59:58,799 --> 01:00:01,020
which you would indeed have done better

1519
01:00:01,020 --> 01:00:03,720
to have resisted

1520
01:00:03,720 --> 01:00:06,780
but whether Justice was fully done is a

1521
01:00:06,780 --> 01:00:09,839
moot point in expectation of reducing

1522
01:00:09,839 --> 01:00:12,119
his own sentence Masterson eventually it

1523
01:00:12,119 --> 01:00:13,859
divulged the names of his accomplices

1524
01:00:13,859 --> 01:00:17,640
and led police to the embezzled bullion

1525
01:00:17,640 --> 01:00:19,619
and although he was committed to prison

1526
01:00:19,619 --> 01:00:22,559
for several years it was clear that once

1527
01:00:22,559 --> 01:00:24,180
his sentence was served he would

1528
01:00:24,180 --> 01:00:27,720
continue the life of a wealthy man

1529
01:00:27,720 --> 01:00:30,299
can't understand I said to Holmes a

1530
01:00:30,299 --> 01:00:32,940
couple of evenings later why you seem so

1531
01:00:32,940 --> 01:00:35,339
damnably happy

1532
01:00:35,339 --> 01:00:38,280
a man is never more content Watson he

1533
01:00:38,280 --> 01:00:40,980
said than when doing well what his

1534
01:00:40,980 --> 01:00:43,020
Nature has fitted him to do

1535
01:00:43,020 --> 01:00:45,299
a witch thought will you pass me the

1536
01:00:45,299 --> 01:00:46,740
tobacco pouch

1537
01:00:46,740 --> 01:00:49,140
I think we should indulge ourselves in a

1538
01:00:49,140 --> 01:00:52,280
brace of good pipes

1539
01:01:05,980 --> 01:01:11,520

01:01:11,520 --> 01:01:15,680

[Music]

1542
01:01:20,040 --> 01:01:23,460
One Fine spring morning Sherlock Holmes

1543
01:01:23,460 --> 01:01:25,559
and I received into our rooms a portly

1544
01:01:25,559 --> 01:01:28,020
gentleman in a purple dress

1545
01:01:28,020 --> 01:01:29,880
that at least is how it momentarily

1546
01:01:29,880 --> 01:01:31,980
appeared to me as I glanced up from the

1547
01:01:31,980 --> 01:01:34,799
Daily Chronicle at the open door

1548
01:01:34,799 --> 01:01:38,339
the purple gentleman it transpired was

1549
01:01:38,339 --> 01:01:40,859
the right Reverend the Lord Bishop of

1550
01:01:40,859 --> 01:01:44,220
Kent an old acquaintance of homes and he

1551
01:01:44,220 --> 01:01:46,140
had brought with him as so many of our

1552
01:01:46,140 --> 01:01:48,839
visitors do a problem that was clearly

1553
01:01:48,839 --> 01:01:51,660
causing him some agitation

1554
01:01:51,660 --> 01:01:54,500
mollified a little by coffee and a cigar

1555
01:01:54,500 --> 01:01:57,480
Bishop Spriggs needed no prompting to

1556
01:01:57,480 --> 01:01:59,400
divulge his story

1557
01:01:59,400 --> 01:02:03,119
the knob of my problem gentlemen is an

1558
01:02:03,119 --> 01:02:04,920
unfortunate young priest

1559
01:02:04,920 --> 01:02:07,859
a young man of promise and talent very

1560
01:02:07,859 --> 01:02:10,140
popular with his parishioners who has

1561
01:02:10,140 --> 01:02:12,119
inadvertently got himself into deep

1562
01:02:12,119 --> 01:02:13,160
water

1563
01:02:13,160 --> 01:02:15,780
intriguing said Holmes

1564
01:02:15,780 --> 01:02:18,059
you may recall the clergyman continued

1565
01:02:18,059 --> 01:02:20,579
the Trinity Church in the Kent Village

1566
01:02:20,579 --> 01:02:23,220
of hechingham was last year in the news

1567
01:02:23,220 --> 01:02:27,119
because of an exceptional discovery of

1568
01:02:27,119 --> 01:02:30,000
course I said a silver chalice of

1569
01:02:30,000 --> 01:02:32,220
considerable worth was discovered in the

1570
01:02:32,220 --> 01:02:36,000
Crypt yes Dr Watson a magnificent

1571
01:02:36,000 --> 01:02:39,180
medieval Relic the so-called hatchingham

1572
01:02:39,180 --> 01:02:42,540
Grail weighing some 22 pounds with my

1573
01:02:42,540 --> 01:02:44,280
approval it was sold to the British

1574
01:02:44,280 --> 01:02:46,920
museum with the idea that a good portion

1575
01:02:46,920 --> 01:02:48,480
of the proceeds would go towards

1576
01:02:48,480 --> 01:02:50,880
restoring hatchingham Church

1577
01:02:50,880 --> 01:02:53,099
the Reverend Kingsley pending the

1578
01:02:53,099 --> 01:02:54,299
beginning of the building work had

1579
01:02:54,299 --> 01:02:56,940
locked the money up in the church Crypt

1580
01:02:56,940 --> 01:03:00,420
it was stolen yesterday

1581
01:03:00,420 --> 01:03:02,579
Holmes you can imagine what an outcry

1582
01:03:02,579 --> 01:03:04,500
they'd be if this found its way into the

1583
01:03:04,500 --> 01:03:07,799
papers it would be bad for Kingsley and

1584
01:03:07,799 --> 01:03:09,839
the hatching comparish and goodness and

1585
01:03:09,839 --> 01:03:11,220
limb knows what it would do for the

1586
01:03:11,220 --> 01:03:12,720
repetition of the church

1587
01:03:12,720 --> 01:03:15,720
at any cost the money must be recovered

1588
01:03:15,720 --> 01:03:17,640
and the thief put away

1589
01:03:17,640 --> 01:03:22,380
and I mean any cost homes let us not

1590
01:03:22,380 --> 01:03:24,180
concern ourselves with fees just yet

1591
01:03:24,180 --> 01:03:26,339
home said

1592
01:03:26,339 --> 01:03:29,099
are there any clues at all as to who

1593
01:03:29,099 --> 01:03:31,500
might be responsible for this theft I'm

1594
01:03:31,500 --> 01:03:33,480
not sure about Clues replied to

1595
01:03:33,480 --> 01:03:36,180
clergyman Kingsley did make some sort of

1596
01:03:36,180 --> 01:03:37,799
an attempt to discover the identity of

1597
01:03:37,799 --> 01:03:39,059
the villain by chasing him over the

1598
01:03:39,059 --> 01:03:41,160
fields after the theft but I'm afraid he

1599
01:03:41,160 --> 01:03:42,780
didn't get very far

1600
01:03:42,780 --> 01:03:44,520
I think we had better meet the young

1601
01:03:44,520 --> 01:03:47,400
Reverend said Holmes as soon as is

1602
01:03:47,400 --> 01:03:49,859
practical Watson would you be at Liberty

1603
01:03:49,859 --> 01:03:51,240
to accompany meter hatching him for a

1604
01:03:51,240 --> 01:03:52,380
few days

1605
01:03:52,380 --> 01:03:55,740
I'm utterly indebted to you both said

1606
01:03:55,740 --> 01:03:57,720
the bishop I dare say while you're in

1607
01:03:57,720 --> 01:03:59,819
hatching him we could put you up at the

1608
01:03:59,819 --> 01:04:01,980
Trinity Church wreck today oh there's

1609
01:04:01,980 --> 01:04:05,359
the Jolly Bulldog if you'd prefer an in

1610
01:04:05,359 --> 01:04:09,299
ah said Holmes that Jolly Bulldog now

1611
01:04:09,299 --> 01:04:13,200
that sounds like just my kind of animal

1612
01:04:13,200 --> 01:04:15,299
we journeyed to hatchingham the next

1613
01:04:15,299 --> 01:04:17,520
morning and established ourselves at the

1614
01:04:17,520 --> 01:04:20,160
Cozy but crumbling hostility that was

1615
01:04:20,160 --> 01:04:22,079
the Jolly bulldog

1616
01:04:22,079 --> 01:04:24,299
our landlord was a bluff man called

1617
01:04:24,299 --> 01:04:27,359
Starkey taller by inches than Holmes and

1618
01:04:27,359 --> 01:04:29,700
compelled to stoop to avoid the beams of

1619
01:04:29,700 --> 01:04:32,040
his own ceiling as he lumbered about in

1620
01:04:32,040 --> 01:04:34,500
heavy boots serving his customers

1621
01:04:34,500 --> 01:04:36,839
he grudgingly provided us with a late

1622
01:04:36,839 --> 01:04:39,240
snack of bread and some rather tough

1623
01:04:39,240 --> 01:04:41,339
cold meats complaining that if everyone

1624
01:04:41,339 --> 01:04:43,140
chose to be fed at half past two in the

1625
01:04:43,140 --> 01:04:44,339
afternoon they would have to invent a

1626
01:04:44,339 --> 01:04:46,079
new word for the meal taken between

1627
01:04:46,079 --> 01:04:48,260
luncheon and dinner

1628
01:04:48,260 --> 01:04:51,420
leftovers said Holmes to me impishly and

1629
01:04:51,420 --> 01:04:53,160
at a level which I am sure Starkey was

1630
01:04:53,160 --> 01:04:56,760
meant to overhear might be that word

1631
01:04:56,760 --> 01:04:59,520
the public and growled ominously as he

1632
01:04:59,520 --> 01:05:01,980
left us and I leaned over to Holmes and

1633
01:05:01,980 --> 01:05:04,680
whispered there is surely an example of

1634
01:05:04,680 --> 01:05:06,720
how a little power may go to the head of

1635
01:05:06,720 --> 01:05:09,720
a man and make him too big for his boots

1636
01:05:09,720 --> 01:05:12,480
I was thinking rather said Holmes from

1637
01:05:12,480 --> 01:05:14,700
the way he clumps about this place that

1638
01:05:14,700 --> 01:05:17,940
his boots are rather too big for him

1639
01:05:17,940 --> 01:05:20,040
I saw the two gentlemen on a nearby

1640
01:05:20,040 --> 01:05:22,680
table smile at this remark

1641
01:05:22,680 --> 01:05:24,480
I shouldn't take a lot of notice of

1642
01:05:24,480 --> 01:05:27,299
Starkey said one of them amiibly he's

1643
01:05:27,299 --> 01:05:29,579
just as tiresome with all the customers

1644
01:05:29,579 --> 01:05:32,280
the gentleman introduced himself as John

1645
01:05:32,280 --> 01:05:34,380
hapten and His companion as Matthew

1646
01:05:34,380 --> 01:05:37,200
Winslow although neither Holmes nor

1647
01:05:37,200 --> 01:05:39,359
myself disclosed the details of our

1648
01:05:39,359 --> 01:05:41,339
mission to hatching him it seems they

1649
01:05:41,339 --> 01:05:43,440
knew we were expected and it turned out

1650
01:05:43,440 --> 01:05:45,599
that both gentlemen were members of the

1651
01:05:45,599 --> 01:05:48,059
parish committee and were fully apprised

1652
01:05:48,059 --> 01:05:50,099
of the theft though they were quick to

1653
01:05:50,099 --> 01:05:52,140
assert that it was not yet public

1654
01:05:52,140 --> 01:05:55,020
knowledge I hope you will be successful

1655
01:05:55,020 --> 01:05:57,780
said Hampton in bringing this thief to

1656
01:05:57,780 --> 01:06:01,500
book we Are fond of our vegan and he has

1657
01:06:01,500 --> 01:06:03,420
been a deeply troubled young man since

1658
01:06:03,420 --> 01:06:05,660
it happened

1659
01:06:05,660 --> 01:06:08,819
the Reverend kingsley's house was

1660
01:06:08,819 --> 01:06:10,799
accessed from hatchingham Lane by a

1661
01:06:10,799 --> 01:06:12,720
short Stone path

1662
01:06:12,720 --> 01:06:15,720
a few steps beyond the vicarage stood

1663
01:06:15,720 --> 01:06:18,299
the church with on the West Side a

1664
01:06:18,299 --> 01:06:20,520
moderate-sized graveyard on the other

1665
01:06:20,520 --> 01:06:22,920
side with its own access to the Lane and

1666
01:06:22,920 --> 01:06:25,740
shaded by a handful of fruit trees stood

1667
01:06:25,740 --> 01:06:28,319
Cherry cottage which we would later

1668
01:06:28,319 --> 01:06:29,880
discover to be the residents of The

1669
01:06:29,880 --> 01:06:32,339
Verge and his wife

1670
01:06:32,339 --> 01:06:35,280
the Reverend Kingsley was a man in his

1671
01:06:35,280 --> 01:06:38,160
early 30s small in stature but of good

1672
01:06:38,160 --> 01:06:40,619
looks his clerical dress the Quint

1673
01:06:40,619 --> 01:06:42,839
essence of neatness

1674
01:06:42,839 --> 01:06:44,760
while clearly stricken by his

1675
01:06:44,760 --> 01:06:46,920
predicament he remained calm and

1676
01:06:46,920 --> 01:06:48,720
articulate and did his best to make us

1677
01:06:48,720 --> 01:06:50,880
welcome in a pleasantly appointed parlor

1678
01:06:50,880 --> 01:06:52,980
whose deep colored thick piled carpet

1679
01:06:52,980 --> 01:06:55,619
and embroidered cushions evidenced a

1680
01:06:55,619 --> 01:06:58,260
delicate sense of taste

1681
01:06:58,260 --> 01:07:00,660
it's a relief to see you gentlemen he

1682
01:07:00,660 --> 01:07:03,119
said the bishop told me all about you

1683
01:07:03,119 --> 01:07:05,940
about your many successes in solving

1684
01:07:05,940 --> 01:07:07,500
complex cases

1685
01:07:07,500 --> 01:07:10,500
the problem as you know is that while we

1686
01:07:10,500 --> 01:07:12,420
saw the thief Escape we were unable to

1687
01:07:12,420 --> 01:07:14,880
establish his identity however there are

1688
01:07:14,880 --> 01:07:17,099
one or two factors which that they seem

1689
01:07:17,099 --> 01:07:19,500
opaque to my own consideration might

1690
01:07:19,500 --> 01:07:23,160
prove Illuminating under your own if I

1691
01:07:23,160 --> 01:07:24,420
might show you

1692
01:07:24,420 --> 01:07:26,640
I would be most grateful Mr Kingsley

1693
01:07:26,640 --> 01:07:29,700
Holmes said first though I see that you

1694
01:07:29,700 --> 01:07:31,200
have recently held a meeting in this

1695
01:07:31,200 --> 01:07:33,420
charming room I presume that apart from

1696
01:07:33,420 --> 01:07:34,920
the three other gentlemen present the

1697
01:07:34,920 --> 01:07:36,420
fourth was yourself

1698
01:07:36,420 --> 01:07:38,400
you keep the side chairs in another room

1699
01:07:38,400 --> 01:07:40,799
I take it

1700
01:07:40,799 --> 01:07:42,539
how did you know all that

1701
01:07:42,539 --> 01:07:44,760
oh it's a simple matter the carpet

1702
01:07:44,760 --> 01:07:46,500
beside the window has indentations of

1703
01:07:46,500 --> 01:07:48,960
four chairs and therefore I presume four

1704
01:07:48,960 --> 01:07:51,299
four people but there are no chairs in

1705
01:07:51,299 --> 01:07:54,359
the room whose feet would match well yes

1706
01:07:54,359 --> 01:07:57,059
you are of course quite correct said

1707
01:07:57,059 --> 01:07:59,700
Kingsley with a broad smile the parish

1708
01:07:59,700 --> 01:08:01,140
committee convened here just yesterday

1709
01:08:01,140 --> 01:08:02,940
as we do each week

1710
01:08:02,940 --> 01:08:05,400
yesterday was the day I broke the news

1711
01:08:05,400 --> 01:08:07,799
that the Grail money had been stolen and

1712
01:08:07,799 --> 01:08:09,839
I hope that that news will remain privy

1713
01:08:09,839 --> 01:08:11,400
to the committee members until such time

1714
01:08:11,400 --> 01:08:13,380
as the thief is caught but

1715
01:08:13,380 --> 01:08:16,439
the vicar paused and Holmes said please

1716
01:08:16,439 --> 01:08:18,719
go on Mr Kingsley

1717
01:08:18,719 --> 01:08:21,719
but continued the young clergyman the

1718
01:08:21,719 --> 01:08:23,279
gentleman on the parish committee are

1719
01:08:23,279 --> 01:08:25,439
the same three who sat here two weeks

1720
01:08:25,439 --> 01:08:26,279
ago

1721
01:08:26,279 --> 01:08:28,799
when I revealed that the money for the

1722
01:08:28,799 --> 01:08:31,799
Grail was in the Crypt of the church

1723
01:08:31,799 --> 01:08:35,100
only they and I knew of the fact you see

1724
01:08:35,100 --> 01:08:37,500
so I can no longer be as confident as

1725
01:08:37,500 --> 01:08:39,238
before that they are all honest men

1726
01:08:39,238 --> 01:08:42,479
which is a most unfortunate thing

1727
01:08:42,479 --> 01:08:45,779
it was all in cash I presume home said

1728
01:08:45,779 --> 01:08:49,020
yes Mr Holmes I kept cash so that I

1729
01:08:49,020 --> 01:08:50,520
could employ local men to restore the

1730
01:08:50,520 --> 01:08:52,738
church and pay them by the day I have

1731
01:08:52,738 --> 01:08:54,060
little time to run to the bank and make

1732
01:08:54,060 --> 01:08:55,500
a withdrawal every time a man finishes

1733
01:08:55,500 --> 01:08:56,880
Plastering a wall

1734
01:08:56,880 --> 01:08:59,160
the money was under lock and key

1735
01:08:59,160 --> 01:09:01,679
yes there is a safe in the Crypt where

1736
01:09:01,679 --> 01:09:03,238
the church's small Treasures have always

1737
01:09:03,238 --> 01:09:04,500
been secreted

1738
01:09:04,500 --> 01:09:08,219
and the Crypt itself is locked yes it

1739
01:09:08,219 --> 01:09:09,899
can be entered either from within the

1740
01:09:09,899 --> 01:09:11,698
church or by a door leading from the

1741
01:09:11,698 --> 01:09:13,920
churchyard and both those doors are

1742
01:09:13,920 --> 01:09:15,600
locked at night

1743
01:09:15,600 --> 01:09:17,399
Mr Holmes

1744
01:09:17,399 --> 01:09:19,738
I do hope you can help me with this

1745
01:09:19,738 --> 01:09:21,540
I don't know how my flock will ever

1746
01:09:21,540 --> 01:09:24,420
forgive me if that money is not returned

1747
01:09:24,420 --> 01:09:26,460
then perhaps if you can bear to go over

1748
01:09:26,460 --> 01:09:28,920
it all again you would be so kind as to

1749
01:09:28,920 --> 01:09:30,540
tell Dr Watson and myself the

1750
01:09:30,540 --> 01:09:32,880
circumstances of the robbery

1751
01:09:32,880 --> 01:09:34,679
yes of course

1752
01:09:34,679 --> 01:09:36,960
two weeks ago looking out of this window

1753
01:09:36,960 --> 01:09:40,738
on a Monday morning at about 11 I saw a

1754
01:09:40,738 --> 01:09:41,759
man

1755
01:09:41,759 --> 01:09:44,520
I'm fairly certain it was a man standing

1756
01:09:44,520 --> 01:09:46,140
at the Lich gate and looking over into

1757
01:09:46,140 --> 01:09:47,339
the chair chart

1758
01:09:47,339 --> 01:09:49,259
I would not have given this a moment's

1759
01:09:49,259 --> 01:09:51,120
thought except that he wore a hat with

1760
01:09:51,120 --> 01:09:53,399
an unusually wide brim and had it pulled

1761
01:09:53,399 --> 01:09:56,340
so low over his eyes and his collar so

1762
01:09:56,340 --> 01:09:58,860
high that one could not distinguish his

1763
01:09:58,860 --> 01:10:00,179
features

1764
01:10:00,179 --> 01:10:02,640
as I say I cannot even be certain was

1765
01:10:02,640 --> 01:10:03,960
not a woman

1766
01:10:03,960 --> 01:10:06,360
except for his way of moving

1767
01:10:06,360 --> 01:10:08,160
I watched him for a good 10 minutes

1768
01:10:08,160 --> 01:10:09,900
before he turned and Strode back along

1769
01:10:09,900 --> 01:10:12,179
the lane towards the village

1770
01:10:12,179 --> 01:10:14,400
that same afternoon this time from an

1771
01:10:14,400 --> 01:10:17,280
upstairs window I saw him again but now

1772
01:10:17,280 --> 01:10:19,500
further along the lane standing under a

1773
01:10:19,500 --> 01:10:22,380
tree and once again seeming to study the

1774
01:10:22,380 --> 01:10:24,480
church and its grounds

1775
01:10:24,480 --> 01:10:28,080
his contrived anonymity naturally put me

1776
01:10:28,080 --> 01:10:29,340
on my guard

1777
01:10:29,340 --> 01:10:31,679
in the evening after those first two

1778
01:10:31,679 --> 01:10:33,900
sightings I was sitting in that very

1779
01:10:33,900 --> 01:10:35,880
chair Dr Watson which you are currently

1780
01:10:35,880 --> 01:10:38,580
occupying when a thought hit me like a

1781
01:10:38,580 --> 01:10:41,340
bolt of lightning I thought which you no

1782
01:10:41,340 --> 01:10:42,900
doubt will be surprised had not occurred

1783
01:10:42,900 --> 01:10:43,980
to me earlier

1784
01:10:43,980 --> 01:10:46,440
that this stranger might have designs on

1785
01:10:46,440 --> 01:10:48,540
the money in the Crypt

1786
01:10:48,540 --> 01:10:52,320
after this alarming Epiphany I spoke to

1787
01:10:52,320 --> 01:10:54,480
my Verger Sam manners and his wife may

1788
01:10:54,480 --> 01:10:57,120
who keep house for me they live in

1789
01:10:57,120 --> 01:10:58,620
Cherry cottage which as you will have

1790
01:10:58,620 --> 01:11:00,179
seen stands on the lane beside the

1791
01:11:00,179 --> 01:11:01,739
church's Lich gate

1792
01:11:01,739 --> 01:11:04,080
there's a shortcut from their back door

1793
01:11:04,080 --> 01:11:05,760
to this house which they employ when

1794
01:11:05,760 --> 01:11:07,500
they wish to see me I mentioned that

1795
01:11:07,500 --> 01:11:09,060
because as I think you would agree it

1796
01:11:09,060 --> 01:11:11,340
Bears upon the matter

1797
01:11:11,340 --> 01:11:14,699
I asked them to report to me if this

1798
01:11:14,699 --> 01:11:16,980
Sinister figure or anyone else unknown

1799
01:11:16,980 --> 01:11:19,020
to them appeared in the vicinity of the

1800
01:11:19,020 --> 01:11:19,980
church

1801
01:11:19,980 --> 01:11:22,980
and indeed it seems as if the man in

1802
01:11:22,980 --> 01:11:24,659
that hat had begun to watch my

1803
01:11:24,659 --> 01:11:26,699
whereabouts because first May manners

1804
01:11:26,699 --> 01:11:29,219
then her husband reported to me that

1805
01:11:29,219 --> 01:11:31,560
they had indeed seen the man in the Hat

1806
01:11:31,560 --> 01:11:34,380
I began to feel that an attempt on the

1807
01:11:34,380 --> 01:11:35,940
money was imminent

1808
01:11:35,940 --> 01:11:38,520
I resolved then to remain in the

1809
01:11:38,520 --> 01:11:40,199
vicarage or the church grounds until I

1810
01:11:40,199 --> 01:11:42,360
was certain that the threat had passed

1811
01:11:42,360 --> 01:11:45,179
I instructed Mr and Mrs manners that if

1812
01:11:45,179 --> 01:11:46,620
they saw the stranger again they were to

1813
01:11:46,620 --> 01:11:48,360
take the shortcut to my house and inform

1814
01:11:48,360 --> 01:11:50,760
me immediately but they were under no

1815
01:11:50,760 --> 01:11:53,040
circumstances to approach him

1816
01:11:53,040 --> 01:11:56,219
and now we come to the day of the theft

1817
01:11:56,219 --> 01:11:58,320
Sam manners was whitewashing the walls

1818
01:11:58,320 --> 01:11:59,699
of the church

1819
01:11:59,699 --> 01:12:02,400
at this point Holmes stood up

1820
01:12:02,400 --> 01:12:04,500
I think it would be as well Mr Kingsley

1821
01:12:04,500 --> 01:12:06,420
to acquaint ourselves with the geography

1822
01:12:06,420 --> 01:12:08,340
of the church and its grounds

1823
01:12:08,340 --> 01:12:11,900
might we continue outside

1824
01:12:12,120 --> 01:12:15,000
a rapturous afternoon of sunshine and

1825
01:12:15,000 --> 01:12:17,100
Birdsong greeted us as we left the

1826
01:12:17,100 --> 01:12:18,659
vicarage and walked out into the

1827
01:12:18,659 --> 01:12:20,699
churchyard where the Reverend Kingsley

1828
01:12:20,699 --> 01:12:23,219
commenced our guided tour

1829
01:12:23,219 --> 01:12:26,040
I immediately began to locate us on a

1830
01:12:26,040 --> 01:12:27,900
mental map of hatchingham village and

1831
01:12:27,900 --> 01:12:29,699
its surrounding areas a practice I

1832
01:12:29,699 --> 01:12:31,440
learned in my Military Days in which has

1833
01:12:31,440 --> 01:12:34,080
served me well in civilian life I could

1834
01:12:34,080 --> 01:12:36,300
see in my mind the large oblong of

1835
01:12:36,300 --> 01:12:39,480
Farmland about two miles across with

1836
01:12:39,480 --> 01:12:40,980
hatchingham Village and the church

1837
01:12:40,980 --> 01:12:43,320
almost at opposite corners

1838
01:12:43,320 --> 01:12:46,260
this substantial area of land was

1839
01:12:46,260 --> 01:12:48,420
surrounded on all four sides by public

1840
01:12:48,420 --> 01:12:50,040
roads

1841
01:12:50,040 --> 01:12:52,080
Mr Kingsley took us through the grounds

1842
01:12:52,080 --> 01:12:53,940
on a grassy path which ran along the

1843
01:12:53,940 --> 01:12:55,440
side of the church up against the

1844
01:12:55,440 --> 01:12:57,420
gravestones of the churchyard

1845
01:12:57,420 --> 01:12:59,520
this is the wall of the church Sarah

1846
01:12:59,520 --> 01:13:01,320
manners was painting that morning said

1847
01:13:01,320 --> 01:13:02,520
the vicar

1848
01:13:02,520 --> 01:13:04,080
he worked for a couple of hours and at

1849
01:13:04,080 --> 01:13:05,880
12 o'clock I sent him off to his cottage

1850
01:13:05,880 --> 01:13:08,760
for his regular midday meal I went back

1851
01:13:08,760 --> 01:13:10,860
into the vicarage and took up a book

1852
01:13:10,860 --> 01:13:13,440
after about 20 minutes there was a knock

1853
01:13:13,440 --> 01:13:14,760
at the back door

1854
01:13:14,760 --> 01:13:16,980
Mrs manners was in a frantic State she

1855
01:13:16,980 --> 01:13:19,020
and Sam had just seen the man in the

1856
01:13:19,020 --> 01:13:20,820
white brimmed hat going into the church

1857
01:13:20,820 --> 01:13:23,580
hat I told her to return immediately and

1858
01:13:23,580 --> 01:13:25,199
to tell Sam to meet me here at the

1859
01:13:25,199 --> 01:13:27,780
crypto and I came here directly to find

1860
01:13:27,780 --> 01:13:31,500
myself staring at a spectacular mess

1861
01:13:31,500 --> 01:13:33,659
he pointed to a flight of four steps

1862
01:13:33,659 --> 01:13:36,179
just off the path leading to a door low

1863
01:13:36,179 --> 01:13:39,239
down in the half-painted church wall

1864
01:13:39,239 --> 01:13:42,060
the door to the Crypt he said from which

1865
01:13:42,060 --> 01:13:43,679
the thief must have made his exit and

1866
01:13:43,679 --> 01:13:45,360
not expecting to encounter a paint

1867
01:13:45,360 --> 01:13:47,940
bucket presumably kicked it flying in

1868
01:13:47,940 --> 01:13:49,920
his haste to escape

1869
01:13:49,920 --> 01:13:52,440
a residual expanse of powdery white

1870
01:13:52,440 --> 01:13:54,900
still damp in places stained the

1871
01:13:54,900 --> 01:13:57,840
flagstones at the bottom of the steps

1872
01:13:57,840 --> 01:14:00,960
Sam was with me within seconds continued

1873
01:14:00,960 --> 01:14:03,780
the vicar we could see nobody but we

1874
01:14:03,780 --> 01:14:05,820
soon guessed which way he'd gone

1875
01:14:05,820 --> 01:14:08,100
if you're following me gentlemen the

1876
01:14:08,100 --> 01:14:09,960
vicar led us a little further along the

1877
01:14:09,960 --> 01:14:11,820
grassy path to where the churchyard

1878
01:14:11,820 --> 01:14:14,580
ended in a wooden fence set into the

1879
01:14:14,580 --> 01:14:17,100
fence was a style leading onto a

1880
01:14:17,100 --> 01:14:18,179
footpath

1881
01:14:18,179 --> 01:14:22,380
that said the vicar was his Escape Route

1882
01:14:22,380 --> 01:14:24,480
beyond the style the Ragged footpath

1883
01:14:24,480 --> 01:14:26,880
traversed the meadow through weeds and

1884
01:14:26,880 --> 01:14:29,640
rough grasses stretching away into the

1885
01:14:29,640 --> 01:14:32,820
distance along this narrow track could

1886
01:14:32,820 --> 01:14:36,120
be seen intermittent Blobs of white

1887
01:14:36,120 --> 01:14:38,040
and I suppose the presumption would be

1888
01:14:38,040 --> 01:14:40,679
said Holmes that the trail of white

1889
01:14:40,679 --> 01:14:42,840
paint marks are the fleeing man's

1890
01:14:42,840 --> 01:14:46,199
footsteps yes exactly obviously our man

1891
01:14:46,199 --> 01:14:48,060
escaped across the field to Harding Lane

1892
01:14:48,060 --> 01:14:51,420
Mr Holmes my companion nodded he stopped

1893
01:14:51,420 --> 01:14:52,739
at the style

1894
01:14:52,739 --> 01:14:55,440
that are two white handprints here he

1895
01:14:55,440 --> 01:14:58,320
said a right hand and a left hand

1896
01:14:58,320 --> 01:15:00,360
the fellows in some haste as indeed one

1897
01:15:00,360 --> 01:15:01,920
would expect

1898
01:15:01,920 --> 01:15:04,320
Holmes crossed the style athletically

1899
01:15:04,320 --> 01:15:07,560
and walked a little way into the field

1900
01:15:07,560 --> 01:15:09,360
bending down he examined one of the

1901
01:15:09,360 --> 01:15:11,280
white marks then plucked up a handful of

1902
01:15:11,280 --> 01:15:13,440
grass and returned to us

1903
01:15:13,440 --> 01:15:15,360
thank you Mr Kingsley I think I've seen

1904
01:15:15,360 --> 01:15:16,980
all I need to hear is there anything

1905
01:15:16,980 --> 01:15:20,100
else you think might help us yes said

1906
01:15:20,100 --> 01:15:22,560
the vicar enthusiastically back at the

1907
01:15:22,560 --> 01:15:24,440
house

1908
01:15:24,440 --> 01:15:27,120
Holmes requested that Sam manners and

1909
01:15:27,120 --> 01:15:29,460
his wife join us in the vicarage and a

1910
01:15:29,460 --> 01:15:31,440
little afterwards in Mr kingsley's

1911
01:15:31,440 --> 01:15:34,320
kitchen Mrs manners set herself to the

1912
01:15:34,320 --> 01:15:36,420
task of making us all tea while Holmes

1913
01:15:36,420 --> 01:15:39,540
paced the stone floor slowly

1914
01:15:39,540 --> 01:15:41,460
I sat at the kitchen table with the

1915
01:15:41,460 --> 01:15:44,820
vicar and Sam manners and Ruddy man in

1916
01:15:44,820 --> 01:15:46,920
his early 40s whom Holmes was now

1917
01:15:46,920 --> 01:15:48,060
addressing

1918
01:15:48,060 --> 01:15:50,159
so Mr manners you are the only person to

1919
01:15:50,159 --> 01:15:51,780
have caught a glimpse of the man in the

1920
01:15:51,780 --> 01:15:53,940
Hat on the day of the robbery I believe

1921
01:15:53,940 --> 01:15:56,580
so sir I was at the window taking my

1922
01:15:56,580 --> 01:15:58,980
lunch I saw this fellow in the Big Air

1923
01:15:58,980 --> 01:16:00,780
looking up and down the lane a few times

1924
01:16:00,780 --> 01:16:03,420
as if to check all was clear then enter

1925
01:16:03,420 --> 01:16:05,040
over the churchyard

1926
01:16:05,040 --> 01:16:06,900
straight away I said to me it's his

1927
01:16:06,900 --> 01:16:09,000
Manos to go by the back door and tell

1928
01:16:09,000 --> 01:16:11,880
the vicar and you yourself waited in the

1929
01:16:11,880 --> 01:16:14,820
cottage until Mrs manners returned I did

1930
01:16:14,820 --> 01:16:15,659
Sir

1931
01:16:15,659 --> 01:16:18,000
for how long not more than two minutes

1932
01:16:18,000 --> 01:16:20,520
she told me the vicar wanted me to meet

1933
01:16:20,520 --> 01:16:23,040
him out by the church I Dash right out

1934
01:16:23,040 --> 01:16:25,739
and found the Reverend Kingsley waiting

1935
01:16:25,739 --> 01:16:28,440
for you yeah sure and the door to the

1936
01:16:28,440 --> 01:16:31,560
 wide open whitewash everywhere hmm

1937
01:16:31,560 --> 01:16:33,540
the crypt door had been locked before

1938
01:16:33,540 --> 01:16:36,360
you went to lunch oh yes Mr Holmes it

1939
01:16:36,360 --> 01:16:38,460
always was and that was when you noticed

1940
01:16:38,460 --> 01:16:40,920
the trail of paint exactly sir and set

1941
01:16:40,920 --> 01:16:42,900
off to follow it you must have only been

1942
01:16:42,900 --> 01:16:45,000
a short way behind the thief

1943
01:16:45,000 --> 01:16:46,980
must have been Sarah but he moved Like

1944
01:16:46,980 --> 01:16:48,060
the Wind

1945
01:16:48,060 --> 01:16:49,920
we was across that Meadow in less than

1946
01:16:49,920 --> 01:16:53,340
five minutes it's good four furlongs and

1947
01:16:53,340 --> 01:16:54,719
never caught up to him

1948
01:16:54,719 --> 01:16:56,520
but what we found at the opposite side

1949
01:16:56,520 --> 01:16:57,960
clinched it

1950
01:16:57,960 --> 01:17:01,500
here Mr Kingsley interrupted Sam means

1951
01:17:01,500 --> 01:17:04,679
this he said and produced from a draw a

1952
01:17:04,679 --> 01:17:06,739
wide brimmed black velvet hat

1953
01:17:06,739 --> 01:17:09,480
inexpensively made and in shape rather

1954
01:17:09,480 --> 01:17:11,219
resembling the sort of thing one sees

1955
01:17:11,219 --> 01:17:13,199
worn by picadors in pictures of

1956
01:17:13,199 --> 01:17:16,380
bullfights Holmes took the hat and

1957
01:17:16,380 --> 01:17:18,960
turned it around in his hands it was me

1958
01:17:18,960 --> 01:17:21,840
found it sir said manners I was running

1959
01:17:21,840 --> 01:17:23,640
a bit ahead of the Reverend open to

1960
01:17:23,640 --> 01:17:25,920
catch up with our thief and as soon as I

1961
01:17:25,920 --> 01:17:27,719
was over the style I saw it in the grass

1962
01:17:27,719 --> 01:17:30,300
by the road just where I suppose it had

1963
01:17:30,300 --> 01:17:33,900
fallen from his head well said Holmes

1964
01:17:33,900 --> 01:17:36,120
while I cannot see yet how that will

1965
01:17:36,120 --> 01:17:37,679
help us with your permission I shall

1966
01:17:37,679 --> 01:17:39,000
take it away with me

1967
01:17:39,000 --> 01:17:40,380
of course

1968
01:17:40,380 --> 01:17:42,960
said to Vicar we'll leave you then but

1969
01:17:42,960 --> 01:17:44,820
by way of that path across the fields

1970
01:17:44,820 --> 01:17:46,620
I'd rather like to follow the route

1971
01:17:46,620 --> 01:17:49,260
taken by our escaping felon

1972
01:17:49,260 --> 01:17:51,540
and so it was that we made our farewells

1973
01:17:51,540 --> 01:17:53,340
and set out from the church out across

1974
01:17:53,340 --> 01:17:56,580
the wide Meadow towards Harding Lane

1975
01:17:56,580 --> 01:17:58,800
although it had been a week since the

1976
01:17:58,800 --> 01:18:01,560
church Thief had fled there remained a

1977
01:18:01,560 --> 01:18:04,380
clear trail of white Footprints across

1978
01:18:04,380 --> 01:18:07,380
the entire width of the field

1979
01:18:07,380 --> 01:18:10,679
the path ended at another style which

1980
01:18:10,679 --> 01:18:12,540
gave onto the Shaded narrowness of

1981
01:18:12,540 --> 01:18:13,980
Harding Lane

1982
01:18:13,980 --> 01:18:16,020
we calculated that the return to

1983
01:18:16,020 --> 01:18:18,179
hatching a village we could go in either

1984
01:18:18,179 --> 01:18:20,040
direction around the perimeter of the

1985
01:18:20,040 --> 01:18:22,739
meadow we took the route West along the

1986
01:18:22,739 --> 01:18:25,020
pincham road rather than going east and

1987
01:18:25,020 --> 01:18:26,820
back via the church

1988
01:18:26,820 --> 01:18:29,040
as we walked my companion looked

1989
01:18:29,040 --> 01:18:31,140
repeatedly this way and that into the

1990
01:18:31,140 --> 01:18:33,239
fields at the roadside the patches of

1991
01:18:33,239 --> 01:18:36,000
scrubland and the bushes and trees

1992
01:18:36,000 --> 01:18:38,159
if you note anything you must let me

1993
01:18:38,159 --> 01:18:40,520
know Watson and I agreed that I would

1994
01:18:40,520 --> 01:18:43,260
but the fields lay bright and innocent

1995
01:18:43,260 --> 01:18:46,140
in the late afternoon air and the trees

1996
01:18:46,140 --> 01:18:48,900
were populated only by birds jubilantly

1997
01:18:48,900 --> 01:18:51,179
enjoying the sunshine

1998
01:18:51,179 --> 01:18:53,520
then as we cross the bridge over a

1999
01:18:53,520 --> 01:18:56,400
gurgling stream homes stopped halfway

2000
01:18:56,400 --> 01:18:59,640
there's something there do you see he

2001
01:18:59,640 --> 01:19:02,219
pointed to the bank of the stream above

2002
01:19:02,219 --> 01:19:04,560
which a Hawthorne overhung the Rushing

2003
01:19:04,560 --> 01:19:07,020
Water something that bush

2004
01:19:07,020 --> 01:19:09,120
a pair of some things unless I'm

2005
01:19:09,120 --> 01:19:10,860
mistaken

2006
01:19:10,860 --> 01:19:12,659
we clambered over the baddestrate of the

2007
01:19:12,659 --> 01:19:14,280
little bridge and dropped onto the bank

2008
01:19:14,280 --> 01:19:15,360
side

2009
01:19:15,360 --> 01:19:17,340
the Hawthorne was thick and even at

2010
01:19:17,340 --> 01:19:19,380
Close Quarters my eyes were at panes to

2011
01:19:19,380 --> 01:19:22,440
penetrate into its depths Holmes using a

2012
01:19:22,440 --> 01:19:24,360
fallen Branch the thickness of his arm

2013
01:19:24,360 --> 01:19:27,600
smashed his way into the bush his soft

2014
01:19:27,600 --> 01:19:30,480
Cry of Triumph told me he had found

2015
01:19:30,480 --> 01:19:32,219
something and he reached in and

2016
01:19:32,219 --> 01:19:35,760
retrieved in one hand a large pair of

2017
01:19:35,760 --> 01:19:37,380
leather boots

2018
01:19:37,380 --> 01:19:40,860
what do you think Watson is this or is

2019
01:19:40,860 --> 01:19:42,659
this not the Footwear of our Thief

2020
01:19:42,659 --> 01:19:45,659
they're certainly large those of a very

2021
01:19:45,659 --> 01:19:47,340
big man I should say

2022
01:19:47,340 --> 01:19:50,280
and that a white marks on the souls

2023
01:19:50,280 --> 01:19:52,020
should we see how they fit those prints

2024
01:19:52,020 --> 01:19:53,699
on the church Meadow

2025
01:19:53,699 --> 01:19:55,980
I think we can assume that much Watson

2026
01:19:55,980 --> 01:19:57,840
but what would induce the villain to

2027
01:19:57,840 --> 01:20:01,380
Jesus in his boots here perhaps I said

2028
01:20:01,380 --> 01:20:03,719
he thought he was still being chased and

2029
01:20:03,719 --> 01:20:05,340
knew that if he were caught wearing them

2030
01:20:05,340 --> 01:20:06,980
he would be recognized straight away

2031
01:20:06,980 --> 01:20:09,300
equally suspicious if he'd been found

2032
01:20:09,300 --> 01:20:11,940
with no boots at all said Holmes though

2033
01:20:11,940 --> 01:20:13,500
I suppose he may have carried a spare

2034
01:20:13,500 --> 01:20:15,659
pair of shoes with him Watson it is

2035
01:20:15,659 --> 01:20:18,120
fairly clear to me the thief is a local

2036
01:20:18,120 --> 01:20:20,760
man why unless he feared to be

2037
01:20:20,760 --> 01:20:22,920
recognized would he indulge in such an

2038
01:20:22,920 --> 01:20:24,659
elaborate disguise

2039
01:20:24,659 --> 01:20:28,080
let us go back to the Jolly Bulldog that

2040
01:20:28,080 --> 01:20:31,199
after all is where the locals like to

2041
01:20:31,199 --> 01:20:33,420
congregate

2042
01:20:33,420 --> 01:20:36,120
in fact on our return to the Inn we

2043
01:20:36,120 --> 01:20:38,159
found John Hampton and Matthew Winslow

2044
01:20:38,159 --> 01:20:39,780
the parish committee men we had met

2045
01:20:39,780 --> 01:20:42,540
earlier having returned to or perhaps

2046
01:20:42,540 --> 01:20:45,420
never having left the same table

2047
01:20:45,420 --> 01:20:47,940
as we sat down Holmes placed beside him

2048
01:20:47,940 --> 01:20:49,920
on the floorboards the pair of boots we

2049
01:20:49,920 --> 01:20:52,080
had found in the Hedgerow causing the

2050
01:20:52,080 --> 01:20:53,400
two gentlemen to look at them

2051
01:20:53,400 --> 01:20:55,140
inquisitively

2052
01:20:55,140 --> 01:20:57,540
when Starkey the landlord arrived to

2053
01:20:57,540 --> 01:21:00,360
service the first thing he said was your

2054
01:21:00,360 --> 01:21:04,260
boats gentlemen not ours said Holmes we

2055
01:21:04,260 --> 01:21:06,320
found them in a bush in Harding Lane

2056
01:21:06,320 --> 01:21:08,880
strange what some folks will throw away

2057
01:21:08,880 --> 01:21:11,880
said the public and they looks in Prime

2058
01:21:11,880 --> 01:21:13,500
order to me

2059
01:21:13,500 --> 01:21:16,320
hardly been worn Holmes replied and then

2060
01:21:16,320 --> 01:21:18,900
he asked would these boots fit you Mr

2061
01:21:18,900 --> 01:21:21,480
Starkey and seeing our companions on the

2062
01:21:21,480 --> 01:21:23,580
nearby table watching he added

2063
01:21:23,580 --> 01:21:26,880
or either of you gentlemen not me sir

2064
01:21:26,880 --> 01:21:29,760
Starkey replied rather more amiably than

2065
01:21:29,760 --> 01:21:31,140
I had expected

2066
01:21:31,140 --> 01:21:33,900
I know my boots look way e but my feet

2067
01:21:33,900 --> 01:21:36,540
and it's a big as you might think it's

2068
01:21:36,540 --> 01:21:38,580
just I'm subject to blisters

2069
01:21:38,580 --> 01:21:41,640
could you find big boots help your

2070
01:21:41,640 --> 01:21:44,340
blisters I asked my experience of

2071
01:21:44,340 --> 01:21:45,540
patients suffering with that condition

2072
01:21:45,540 --> 01:21:49,320
telling me the opposite no sir to start

2073
01:21:49,320 --> 01:21:51,060
the blisters I need to put on three

2074
01:21:51,060 --> 01:21:53,340
pairs of thick hose so always gets my

2075
01:21:53,340 --> 01:21:56,219
boots well over in my proper foot size

2076
01:21:56,219 --> 01:21:59,100
then rather sardonically he said

2077
01:21:59,100 --> 01:22:02,159
thank you though for asking sir

2078
01:22:02,159 --> 01:22:06,260
Mr Hampton on the next table asked

2079
01:22:06,620 --> 01:22:10,500
what's your interest in Boots Holmes

2080
01:22:10,500 --> 01:22:12,540
said it's an investigation we are

2081
01:22:12,540 --> 01:22:16,260
conducting in which boots have well some

2082
01:22:16,260 --> 01:22:18,719
scientific significance

2083
01:22:18,719 --> 01:22:20,880
then to me he whispered as our neighbor

2084
01:22:20,880 --> 01:22:24,060
turned away with a disbelieving grimace

2085
01:22:24,060 --> 01:22:29,040
as I thought Watson we have our culprit

2086
01:22:29,040 --> 01:22:33,780
Starkey no not Starkey one of these

2087
01:22:33,780 --> 01:22:36,060
and I indicated with my thumb the two

2088
01:22:36,060 --> 01:22:38,820
men from the parish committee oh Watson

2089
01:22:38,820 --> 01:22:41,340
who then these boots Watson Do You

2090
01:22:41,340 --> 01:22:43,500
observe nothing untoward about them

2091
01:22:43,500 --> 01:22:46,739
no not at all the practically knew that

2092
01:22:46,739 --> 01:22:48,900
of a large size apart from that they are

2093
01:22:48,900 --> 01:22:50,460
undistinguished

2094
01:22:50,460 --> 01:22:53,100
on the contrary my friend I would say

2095
01:22:53,100 --> 01:22:55,320
they were distinguished by a lack of

2096
01:22:55,320 --> 01:22:58,860
paint a baker pardon I mean Watson that

2097
01:22:58,860 --> 01:23:00,540
there are white marks on the souls to be

2098
01:23:00,540 --> 01:23:02,460
sure but tell me pray have a man with

2099
01:23:02,460 --> 01:23:03,780
his hands covered in whitewash could

2100
01:23:03,780 --> 01:23:05,040
have unlaced and removed his boots

2101
01:23:05,040 --> 01:23:07,620
without leaving marks on the laces I

2102
01:23:07,620 --> 01:23:10,260
don't know I said but it would be a

2103
01:23:10,260 --> 01:23:11,820
singular coincidence if someone

2104
01:23:11,820 --> 01:23:14,159
completely innocent had jettisoned a

2105
01:23:14,159 --> 01:23:16,380
pair of boots with paint on the Soles

2106
01:23:16,380 --> 01:23:19,199
there is no coincidence Holmes said

2107
01:23:19,199 --> 01:23:21,420
These boots were undoubtedly left here

2108
01:23:21,420 --> 01:23:23,760
by the thief but not in the way we were

2109
01:23:23,760 --> 01:23:26,159
intended to believe are you suggesting

2110
01:23:26,159 --> 01:23:28,440
that you know who the thief is

2111
01:23:28,440 --> 01:23:31,620
the thief Watson is the reverent

2112
01:23:31,620 --> 01:23:33,420
Kingsley himself

2113
01:23:33,420 --> 01:23:36,120
how could it be homes there was no time

2114
01:23:36,120 --> 01:23:38,100
for him to escape across that Meadow and

2115
01:23:38,100 --> 01:23:39,900
return to the vicarage in time to meet

2116
01:23:39,900 --> 01:23:42,420
Sam manners outside the church How could

2117
01:23:42,420 --> 01:23:44,880
a man Chase himself across a meadow

2118
01:23:44,880 --> 01:23:47,159
as you know Watson we are due to meet

2119
01:23:47,159 --> 01:23:48,420
the bishop this evening at Trinity

2120
01:23:48,420 --> 01:23:49,800
vicarage

2121
01:23:49,800 --> 01:23:52,560
so let us finish our meal I will explain

2122
01:23:52,560 --> 01:23:55,520
everything there

2123
01:23:56,040 --> 01:23:58,080
we had promised the bishop an interim

2124
01:23:58,080 --> 01:23:59,940
meeting at the vicarage to advise him of

2125
01:23:59,940 --> 01:24:02,760
our progress in the case which no doubt

2126
01:24:02,760 --> 01:24:04,440
the clergyman expected to be only

2127
01:24:04,440 --> 01:24:06,719
moderate this soon after our previous

2128
01:24:06,719 --> 01:24:09,360
meeting but we had hardly settled to our

2129
01:24:09,360 --> 01:24:10,980
Sherry in Mr kingsley's comfortable

2130
01:24:10,980 --> 01:24:13,380
parlor then Holmes declared dramatically

2131
01:24:13,380 --> 01:24:15,600
you will no doubt be delighted to know

2132
01:24:15,600 --> 01:24:17,159
gentlemen that Dr Watson and I have

2133
01:24:17,159 --> 01:24:19,260
solved the case

2134
01:24:19,260 --> 01:24:20,940
I did not think of my business to

2135
01:24:20,940 --> 01:24:22,260
confess that after my previous

2136
01:24:22,260 --> 01:24:24,420
conversation with Holmes I was as much

2137
01:24:24,420 --> 01:24:27,239
in the dark as anyone but I sat quietly

2138
01:24:27,239 --> 01:24:29,460
sipping my Shetty while I watched my

2139
01:24:29,460 --> 01:24:31,140
friend open the bag we had brought from

2140
01:24:31,140 --> 01:24:33,719
the inn and removed the two large white

2141
01:24:33,719 --> 01:24:35,820
stained boots we had found beside the

2142
01:24:35,820 --> 01:24:36,840
Stream

2143
01:24:36,840 --> 01:24:39,540
The Bishop's eyes widened

2144
01:24:39,540 --> 01:24:42,300
I have to say he looked incredulous

2145
01:24:42,300 --> 01:24:45,540
Mr Kingsley too wore a skeptical smirk

2146
01:24:45,540 --> 01:24:48,900
and raised his eyebrows please tell us

2147
01:24:48,900 --> 01:24:52,380
Mr Holmes what you think you have found

2148
01:24:52,380 --> 01:24:54,900
Dr Watson and I found these Holmes

2149
01:24:54,900 --> 01:24:57,360
explained in a bramble bush in Harding

2150
01:24:57,360 --> 01:24:58,260
Lane

2151
01:24:58,260 --> 01:25:00,960
big boots suggested we were seeking a

2152
01:25:00,960 --> 01:25:03,780
big man yet the footprints told us his

2153
01:25:03,780 --> 01:25:05,340
stride was short

2154
01:25:05,340 --> 01:25:07,560
it was our landlord at the Jolly Bulldog

2155
01:25:07,560 --> 01:25:09,060
who enabled me to understand the

2156
01:25:09,060 --> 01:25:11,460
dichotomy he is a man who buys bigger

2157
01:25:11,460 --> 01:25:12,960
boots than his foot size in order to

2158
01:25:12,960 --> 01:25:15,540
accommodate extra socks our villain

2159
01:25:15,540 --> 01:25:17,280
however bought his bigger boots in order

2160
01:25:17,280 --> 01:25:19,080
to accommodate another pair of shoes

2161
01:25:19,080 --> 01:25:21,659
leaving the footprints of a bigger man

2162
01:25:21,659 --> 01:25:23,820
than he is himself

2163
01:25:23,820 --> 01:25:28,080
is that not so Mr Kingsley

2164
01:25:28,080 --> 01:25:30,900
the young vicar I thought at the time if

2165
01:25:30,900 --> 01:25:32,820
he was guilty of anything

2166
01:25:32,820 --> 01:25:36,060
was heroically cool about it

2167
01:25:36,060 --> 01:25:39,060
he betrayed nothing but gentile's

2168
01:25:39,060 --> 01:25:40,500
surprise

2169
01:25:40,500 --> 01:25:42,719
are you suggesting that I was the thief

2170
01:25:42,719 --> 01:25:44,340
Mr hobbed

2171
01:25:44,340 --> 01:25:47,940
Holmes said the bishop Gravely

2172
01:25:47,940 --> 01:25:50,580
from what I understand Mr Kingsley and

2173
01:25:50,580 --> 01:25:52,980
his Verger practically managed to catch

2174
01:25:52,980 --> 01:25:56,159
up with the thief on that fateful day

2175
01:25:56,159 --> 01:25:58,260
what on Earth do you think is the

2176
01:25:58,260 --> 01:26:00,239
evidence for this assertion

2177
01:26:00,239 --> 01:26:03,480
my Lord Holmes said confidently Mr

2178
01:26:03,480 --> 01:26:05,159
Kingsley wished to embezzle the money

2179
01:26:05,159 --> 01:26:07,020
raised by the sale of the hatchingham

2180
01:26:07,020 --> 01:26:08,940
Grail and decided to construct a piece

2181
01:26:08,940 --> 01:26:10,139
of Theater which would deceive

2182
01:26:10,139 --> 01:26:12,540
investigators he not only invented the

2183
01:26:12,540 --> 01:26:14,580
spectral man and the large brimmed hat

2184
01:26:14,580 --> 01:26:18,000
he also on several occasions paraded in

2185
01:26:18,000 --> 01:26:20,100
the Hat in the high collared coat and

2186
01:26:20,100 --> 01:26:22,440
ensured that Mr and Mrs manners caught a

2187
01:26:22,440 --> 01:26:24,540
glimpse of him on the day of the theft

2188
01:26:24,540 --> 01:26:27,060
having sent Sam manners to lunch he came

2189
01:26:27,060 --> 01:26:29,460
back here to the vicarage assumed the

2190
01:26:29,460 --> 01:26:31,440
disguise showed himself at the cottage

2191
01:26:31,440 --> 01:26:33,659
window where manners was eating and

2192
01:26:33,659 --> 01:26:36,000
proceeded into the churchyard

2193
01:26:36,000 --> 01:26:38,400
dashing back to the vicodage again he

2194
01:26:38,400 --> 01:26:40,080
slipped out of his cloak and hat and

2195
01:26:40,080 --> 01:26:41,880
waited for Mrs manners knock on the door

2196
01:26:41,880 --> 01:26:44,400
he told Mrs manners to summon her

2197
01:26:44,400 --> 01:26:46,860
husband and rendezvous with him outside

2198
01:26:46,860 --> 01:26:50,460
the crypt door and then what said Mr

2199
01:26:50,460 --> 01:26:53,280
Kingsley insolent with Fury I put on

2200
01:26:53,280 --> 01:26:55,800
these boots unlocked the church went

2201
01:26:55,800 --> 01:26:58,199
down to the Crypt took the money escaped

2202
01:26:58,199 --> 01:27:00,300
the church jumped the style and ran

2203
01:27:00,300 --> 01:27:02,219
across a mile at the field then dashed a

2204
01:27:02,219 --> 01:27:03,840
mile back took off the boots and waited

2205
01:27:03,840 --> 01:27:06,480
calmly for Sam to arrive whereupon I

2206
01:27:06,480 --> 01:27:09,540
went chasing off across the field again

2207
01:27:09,540 --> 01:27:13,139
that would indeed have been ingenious to

2208
01:27:13,139 --> 01:27:15,420
do in two minutes what an athlete could

2209
01:27:15,420 --> 01:27:19,679
not do in 20. yes indeed the question as

2210
01:27:19,679 --> 01:27:21,840
my friend Dr Watson has clarified is

2211
01:27:21,840 --> 01:27:24,540
precisely how may a man Chase himself

2212
01:27:24,540 --> 01:27:26,400
across a meadow

2213
01:27:26,400 --> 01:27:30,000
and the answer asked the bishop

2214
01:27:30,000 --> 01:27:31,800
no one will ever know at what point you

2215
01:27:31,800 --> 01:27:33,780
took the money Mr Kingsley

2216
01:27:33,780 --> 01:27:35,699
as the keyhole that you are free to do

2217
01:27:35,699 --> 01:27:38,520
it at your leisure and for all one knows

2218
01:27:38,520 --> 01:27:40,380
it may never have been in the Crypt safe

2219
01:27:40,380 --> 01:27:42,780
in the first place certainly there was

2220
01:27:42,780 --> 01:27:45,179
no need for you to waste time on it on

2221
01:27:45,179 --> 01:27:47,520
the day we are discussing you wished to

2222
01:27:47,520 --> 01:27:49,440
ensure there was just enough time with

2223
01:27:49,440 --> 01:27:51,239
Mr manners at lunch for you to get to

2224
01:27:51,239 --> 01:27:52,920
the crypto and kick over the white wash

2225
01:27:52,920 --> 01:27:55,620
bucket and of course you had given Mr

2226
01:27:55,620 --> 01:27:57,480
Manus the task of whitewashing that

2227
01:27:57,480 --> 01:27:58,920
particular part of the church wall

2228
01:27:58,920 --> 01:28:01,020
simply to ensure that there would be a

2229
01:28:01,020 --> 01:28:03,420
bucket there to be upturned

2230
01:28:03,420 --> 01:28:06,179
that was all you needed to do because

2231
01:28:06,179 --> 01:28:10,080
and here is the thing you had made the

2232
01:28:10,080 --> 01:28:12,840
footprints across the field on the night

2233
01:28:12,840 --> 01:28:14,580
before

2234
01:28:14,580 --> 01:28:16,560
you would also I have no doubt planted

2235
01:28:16,560 --> 01:28:17,940
the boots in the Hedgerow on the same

2236
01:28:17,940 --> 01:28:19,679
occasion making sure they had plenty of

2237
01:28:19,679 --> 01:28:23,100
white paint on the Soles foolishly you

2238
01:28:23,100 --> 01:28:25,320
forgot to dorb a little on the shoe

2239
01:28:25,320 --> 01:28:27,239
laces

2240
01:28:27,239 --> 01:28:30,360
at this point the vicar dropped into a

2241
01:28:30,360 --> 01:28:32,760
chair as though all resistance had

2242
01:28:32,760 --> 01:28:34,320
suddenly fled him

2243
01:28:34,320 --> 01:28:37,320
and I believe that as Holmes proceeded

2244
01:28:37,320 --> 01:28:39,600
we all realized that he was now

2245
01:28:39,600 --> 01:28:42,540
approaching a devastating conclusion at

2246
01:28:42,540 --> 01:28:44,460
some out of that night Mr Kingsley

2247
01:28:44,460 --> 01:28:46,800
having splashed so much whitewash on the

2248
01:28:46,800 --> 01:28:48,239
underside of the boots that your hands

2249
01:28:48,239 --> 01:28:50,400
were gloved with paint you planted your

2250
01:28:50,400 --> 01:28:52,500
white printed Trail along the footpath

2251
01:28:52,500 --> 01:28:54,900
across the meadow to Harding Lane

2252
01:28:54,900 --> 01:28:57,420
afterwards you dropped the wide brimmed

2253
01:28:57,420 --> 01:28:59,400
hat by the style and jettisoned the

2254
01:28:59,400 --> 01:29:01,620
boots in a bush further along Harding

2255
01:29:01,620 --> 01:29:02,699
Lane

2256
01:29:02,699 --> 01:29:04,920
the trail of Prince was therefore neatly

2257
01:29:04,920 --> 01:29:06,540
in place for the deception next morning

2258
01:29:06,540 --> 01:29:08,580
and I dare say you were solicitors to

2259
01:29:08,580 --> 01:29:10,380
keep Mr manners away from the style

2260
01:29:10,380 --> 01:29:12,719
where he might prematurely stumble upon

2261
01:29:12,719 --> 01:29:16,860
your if I may so miss name it handiwork

2262
01:29:16,860 --> 01:29:20,040
but one moment said the bishop

2263
01:29:20,040 --> 01:29:22,860
if Mr Kingsley had dropped the Hat the

2264
01:29:22,860 --> 01:29:25,080
night before how could he have been

2265
01:29:25,080 --> 01:29:27,120
wearing it that morning

2266
01:29:27,120 --> 01:29:30,600
well of course that's simple said Holmes

2267
01:29:30,600 --> 01:29:34,500
there were two hats and finally there

2268
01:29:34,500 --> 01:29:36,960
was the question of the keys what

2269
01:29:36,960 --> 01:29:39,540
question was that Holmes I asked I don't

2270
01:29:39,540 --> 01:29:41,580
recollect any mention of keys

2271
01:29:41,580 --> 01:29:42,960
precisely

2272
01:29:42,960 --> 01:29:45,360
there was a distinct absence of any such

2273
01:29:45,360 --> 01:29:48,239
mention why because a key would have

2274
01:29:48,239 --> 01:29:50,219
been needed to enter the Crypt and Mr

2275
01:29:50,219 --> 01:29:52,199
Kingsley thought it better not to raise

2276
01:29:52,199 --> 01:29:54,239
the tricky matter of how such an

2277
01:29:54,239 --> 01:29:57,480
intruder might have got hold of one

2278
01:29:57,480 --> 01:30:00,480
the pale face and slumped figure of Mr

2279
01:30:00,480 --> 01:30:04,560
Kingsley indicated his utter defeat

2280
01:30:04,560 --> 01:30:07,440
the bishop clearly needed no further

2281
01:30:07,440 --> 01:30:08,639
convincing

2282
01:30:08,639 --> 01:30:10,860
the money Kingsley

2283
01:30:10,860 --> 01:30:12,060
he said

2284
01:30:12,060 --> 01:30:13,980
have you spent it

2285
01:30:13,980 --> 01:30:16,080
the vicar looked bitter

2286
01:30:16,080 --> 01:30:18,420
I'm a gambler Bishop

2287
01:30:18,420 --> 01:30:20,159
and the truth is that over the years I

2288
01:30:20,159 --> 01:30:23,400
have burdened myself with appalling debt

2289
01:30:23,400 --> 01:30:25,560
I started to use the church money bit by

2290
01:30:25,560 --> 01:30:28,139
bit I meant to return it one day when I

2291
01:30:28,139 --> 01:30:29,760
had a big win but

2292
01:30:29,760 --> 01:30:33,420
money runs through my hands like water

2293
01:30:33,420 --> 01:30:35,940
there's little of it left

2294
01:30:35,940 --> 01:30:38,100
then it's a matter for the police

2295
01:30:38,100 --> 01:30:39,900
the bishop said

2296
01:30:39,900 --> 01:30:42,600
and we must find a new vicar for

2297
01:30:42,600 --> 01:30:43,860
hatching them

2298
01:30:43,860 --> 01:30:46,980
I fear that you Mr Kingsley will for

2299
01:30:46,980 --> 01:30:49,679
many years be the incumbent of a much

2300
01:30:49,679 --> 01:30:53,420
dingier perish

2301
01:31:04,660 --> 01:31:05,940
[Music]

2302
01:31:05,940 --> 01:31:09,679
the 1059 assassin

2303
01:31:09,830 --> 01:31:13,600
[Music]

2304
01:31:14,159 --> 01:31:16,020
it is now well known that the

2305
01:31:16,020 --> 01:31:17,699
investigations of my friend and

2306
01:31:17,699 --> 01:31:20,340
companion Sherlock Holmes which I have

2307
01:31:20,340 --> 01:31:22,139
had the privilege to document over the

2308
01:31:22,139 --> 01:31:25,440
years represent only a small portion of

2309
01:31:25,440 --> 01:31:27,000
his life's work

2310
01:31:27,000 --> 01:31:29,639
many other cases have fallen into the

2311
01:31:29,639 --> 01:31:31,760
Obscure well of history

2312
01:31:31,760 --> 01:31:34,860
but nothing departs this world without

2313
01:31:34,860 --> 01:31:38,280
leaving some trace or memory and now and

2314
01:31:38,280 --> 01:31:41,820
then an old story rears its head so it

2315
01:31:41,820 --> 01:31:45,600
was with the events of the stovey murder

2316
01:31:45,600 --> 01:31:47,880
A letter came to Holmes one morning at

2317
01:31:47,880 --> 01:31:50,159
our Baker Street Department from Samuel

2318
01:31:50,159 --> 01:31:52,920
Carpenter an elderly Publican at the

2319
01:31:52,920 --> 01:31:55,139
horse in colors hostery in the Kent

2320
01:31:55,139 --> 01:31:56,940
Village of stovy

2321
01:31:56,940 --> 01:31:58,860
several years previously Samuel

2322
01:31:58,860 --> 01:32:00,540
Carpenter had been a witness at the

2323
01:32:00,540 --> 01:32:03,840
trial of Arthur weeks a local villain

2324
01:32:03,840 --> 01:32:06,179
accused of intimidation abduction

2325
01:32:06,179 --> 01:32:08,840
blackmail and Grievous bodily harm

2326
01:32:08,840 --> 01:32:11,100
Holmes had been involved in helping

2327
01:32:11,100 --> 01:32:13,020
police on the case with footprint

2328
01:32:13,020 --> 01:32:15,179
evidence and thus had come to meet the

2329
01:32:15,179 --> 01:32:17,100
amiable publican

2330
01:32:17,100 --> 01:32:19,500
I suppose we never expected to visit the

2331
01:32:19,500 --> 01:32:21,659
quatt settlement of stovey ever again

2332
01:32:21,659 --> 01:32:24,540
but the letter contained a clear and

2333
01:32:24,540 --> 01:32:26,880
Urgent summons

2334
01:32:26,880 --> 01:32:28,739
Dear Mr Holmes

2335
01:32:28,739 --> 01:32:30,780
you did say when we made our fell Wells

2336
01:32:30,780 --> 01:32:33,360
four years ago that if ever there should

2337
01:32:33,360 --> 01:32:34,860
be a day when I had need of your

2338
01:32:34,860 --> 01:32:36,960
assistance I was to write to you

2339
01:32:36,960 --> 01:32:40,080
immediately I'm afraid sir

2340
01:32:40,080 --> 01:32:41,940
that day has come

2341
01:32:41,940 --> 01:32:44,280
a terrible set of events has clouded my

2342
01:32:44,280 --> 01:32:46,620
life and I am quite a loss

2343
01:32:46,620 --> 01:32:49,860
Arthur wakes that ruthless villain you

2344
01:32:49,860 --> 01:32:53,280
hoped put away died in jail a few months

2345
01:32:53,280 --> 01:32:54,179
ago

2346
01:32:54,179 --> 01:32:57,420
ever since then his son Henry has been

2347
01:32:57,420 --> 01:33:00,000
making our lives a misery

2348
01:33:00,000 --> 01:33:03,420
I found my dog catcher shot dead in the

2349
01:33:03,420 --> 01:33:04,199
field

2350
01:33:04,199 --> 01:33:07,920
and twice a dead fox in our water tank

2351
01:33:07,920 --> 01:33:10,440
started getting letters threatening to

2352
01:33:10,440 --> 01:33:12,600
burn down the Inn telling me I should

2353
01:33:12,600 --> 01:33:14,820
one day wait in vain for my wife to come

2354
01:33:14,820 --> 01:33:17,520
home terrible things but all written

2355
01:33:17,520 --> 01:33:18,659
anonymous

2356
01:33:18,659 --> 01:33:21,480
then he brazenly come and drink at the

2357
01:33:21,480 --> 01:33:23,639
end as innocent as you like

2358
01:33:23,639 --> 01:33:27,420
well last week our son jack told weeks

2359
01:33:27,420 --> 01:33:28,920
straight there in front of all my

2360
01:33:28,920 --> 01:33:29,940
customers

2361
01:33:29,940 --> 01:33:32,460
that he'd gone too far and he'd better

2362
01:33:32,460 --> 01:33:34,139
prepare himself for some serious

2363
01:33:34,139 --> 01:33:37,080
consequences I wish she had not done it

2364
01:33:37,080 --> 01:33:40,199
two days afterwards weeks was found

2365
01:33:40,199 --> 01:33:43,620
shocked through the head and my Jack is

2366
01:33:43,620 --> 01:33:46,080
now being arrested as a murderer

2367
01:33:46,080 --> 01:33:48,239
there's anything you may be able to do

2368
01:33:48,239 --> 01:33:49,560
Mr ohms

2369
01:33:49,560 --> 01:33:52,620
please come immediately

2370
01:33:52,620 --> 01:33:54,960
I knew that Holmes had taken strongly to

2371
01:33:54,960 --> 01:33:57,120
the public and so it was hardly a

2372
01:33:57,120 --> 01:33:59,100
surprise to me when he asked as is his

2373
01:33:59,100 --> 01:34:01,020
way whether I had any pressing

2374
01:34:01,020 --> 01:34:03,300
engagements over the next few days and

2375
01:34:03,300 --> 01:34:05,699
when I said no instructed me to pack

2376
01:34:05,699 --> 01:34:08,340
immediately an overnight bag within an

2377
01:34:08,340 --> 01:34:12,360
hour we were aboard a Kent bound train

2378
01:34:12,360 --> 01:34:14,880
in stovey Village we took rooms at the

2379
01:34:14,880 --> 01:34:17,280
horse in colors and as soon as we were

2380
01:34:17,280 --> 01:34:19,980
settled in sat with our landlord at a

2381
01:34:19,980 --> 01:34:22,199
table in the bar where a large fire

2382
01:34:22,199 --> 01:34:24,780
battled the chill in the air

2383
01:34:24,780 --> 01:34:26,460
Holmes said

2384
01:34:26,460 --> 01:34:28,260
now Mr Carpenter

2385
01:34:28,260 --> 01:34:30,300
the first thing you must do if I'm to

2386
01:34:30,300 --> 01:34:32,280
help you is to answer my questions

2387
01:34:32,280 --> 01:34:34,860
honestly and accurately

2388
01:34:34,860 --> 01:34:37,560
that I will do Mr Holmes

2389
01:34:37,560 --> 01:34:39,840
your Jack made a threat to Henry weeks

2390
01:34:39,840 --> 01:34:42,900
here in this bar yes sir and two days

2391
01:34:42,900 --> 01:34:45,659
later weeks was found dead dead with a

2392
01:34:45,659 --> 01:34:47,820
shot through his head just outside the

2393
01:34:47,820 --> 01:34:49,620
village where Nightingale Lane crosses

2394
01:34:49,620 --> 01:34:51,719
the London Railway line and his horse

2395
01:34:51,719 --> 01:34:54,600
tied up nearby and they came to arrest

2396
01:34:54,600 --> 01:34:58,080
Jack when that very night but Jack

2397
01:34:58,080 --> 01:35:01,320
wasn't here of course wasn't here Jack

2398
01:35:01,320 --> 01:35:04,199
couldn't have killed him Mr ohms Jack

2399
01:35:04,199 --> 01:35:06,179
was already aboard the London train when

2400
01:35:06,179 --> 01:35:07,739
weeks was killed

2401
01:35:07,739 --> 01:35:10,139
it was offered by himself a suit for his

2402
01:35:10,139 --> 01:35:11,219
wedding

2403
01:35:11,219 --> 01:35:14,040
I took him to stovey station myself that

2404
01:35:14,040 --> 01:35:17,219
evening to catch the 10 59. there were a

2405
01:35:17,219 --> 01:35:19,380
moment when Jack left my sight I watched

2406
01:35:19,380 --> 01:35:21,120
him get on that train and waved him off

2407
01:35:21,120 --> 01:35:22,260
as it left

2408
01:35:22,260 --> 01:35:24,239
but the police didn't seem to think that

2409
01:35:24,239 --> 01:35:25,800
counts for anything

2410
01:35:25,800 --> 01:35:27,540
as soon as he got back here next day

2411
01:35:27,540 --> 01:35:29,820
they carted him off and he's now on the

2412
01:35:29,820 --> 01:35:32,159
lock and key in Maidstone jail

2413
01:35:32,159 --> 01:35:34,920
well Mr Carpenter said Holmes I accept

2414
01:35:34,920 --> 01:35:36,659
unequivocally that what you are telling

2415
01:35:36,659 --> 01:35:39,360
me is the truth but my sense is that

2416
01:35:39,360 --> 01:35:40,920
this is going to be a very convoluted

2417
01:35:40,920 --> 01:35:43,020
business and I must impress on you the

2418
01:35:43,020 --> 01:35:44,880
need to be patient

2419
01:35:44,880 --> 01:35:46,980
when Carpenter had returned to serving

2420
01:35:46,980 --> 01:35:49,139
his customers I said quietly to Holmes

2421
01:35:49,139 --> 01:35:51,960
surely if what the old chap says is true

2422
01:35:51,960 --> 01:35:54,840
the police have no case weeks must have

2423
01:35:54,840 --> 01:35:56,940
had a hundred enemies hungry for his

2424
01:35:56,940 --> 01:35:59,159
blood with thought we could Alibis than

2425
01:35:59,159 --> 01:36:00,600
Jack Carpenter

2426
01:36:00,600 --> 01:36:04,199
perhaps so said Holmes but I fear the

2427
01:36:04,199 --> 01:36:05,940
word of a father in defense of a son is

2428
01:36:05,940 --> 01:36:07,560
unlikely to be regarded in quarters

2429
01:36:07,560 --> 01:36:09,719
compelling evidence especially when the

2430
01:36:09,719 --> 01:36:11,280
police have their minds made up in

2431
01:36:11,280 --> 01:36:12,420
advance

2432
01:36:12,420 --> 01:36:14,760
Watson I have a suspicion that things

2433
01:36:14,760 --> 01:36:16,920
may get a lot more obscure before they

2434
01:36:16,920 --> 01:36:19,199
become clearer let's make good use of

2435
01:36:19,199 --> 01:36:20,820
the afternoon by acquainting ourselves

2436
01:36:20,820 --> 01:36:22,800
with the details of Henry week's

2437
01:36:22,800 --> 01:36:25,620
unfortunate end

2438
01:36:25,620 --> 01:36:28,440
our escort to the scene of the crime was

2439
01:36:28,440 --> 01:36:31,440
a local policeman Sergeant Berry a man

2440
01:36:31,440 --> 01:36:34,199
of stubborn practicality whose uniform

2441
01:36:34,199 --> 01:36:36,480
one suspected must have been artfully

2442
01:36:36,480 --> 01:36:39,000
augmented to accommodate the spectacular

2443
01:36:39,000 --> 01:36:41,639
retundity of his belly

2444
01:36:41,639 --> 01:36:43,800
he clearly felt he had better things to

2445
01:36:43,800 --> 01:36:45,780
do than to accompany a Consulting

2446
01:36:45,780 --> 01:36:47,940
detective to the scene of a crime when

2447
01:36:47,940 --> 01:36:50,040
the culprit was already halfway to The

2448
01:36:50,040 --> 01:36:51,780
Gallows

2449
01:36:51,780 --> 01:36:54,179
walking from stovey Village we arrived

2450
01:36:54,179 --> 01:36:56,280
at a spot about 30 yards from a level

2451
01:36:56,280 --> 01:36:58,440
crossing where the main London Railway

2452
01:36:58,440 --> 01:37:01,440
line traversed Nightingale Lane

2453
01:37:01,440 --> 01:37:04,620
dark Hill Crossing co-ops found here

2454
01:37:04,620 --> 01:37:07,440
Sergeant Betty said bluntly six feet

2455
01:37:07,440 --> 01:37:10,320
from the fence victims are still tied to

2456
01:37:10,320 --> 01:37:12,120
defense cause of death single bullet

2457
01:37:12,120 --> 01:37:13,679
entering just here

2458
01:37:13,679 --> 01:37:15,900
he put a plump finger in the center of

2459
01:37:15,900 --> 01:37:16,920
his brow

2460
01:37:16,920 --> 01:37:20,400
weapon a gun said the policeman

2461
01:37:20,400 --> 01:37:23,580
insolently I am aware said Holmes

2462
01:37:23,580 --> 01:37:25,679
clearly irritated that if a man is

2463
01:37:25,679 --> 01:37:27,000
killed with a bullet then the probable

2464
01:37:27,000 --> 01:37:29,219
source of the missile is a firearm what

2465
01:37:29,219 --> 01:37:30,659
I want to know is whether the weapon has

2466
01:37:30,659 --> 01:37:33,060
been found or if not whether anyone has

2467
01:37:33,060 --> 01:37:35,760
deduced the type of gun from the type of

2468
01:37:35,760 --> 01:37:36,659
bullet

2469
01:37:36,659 --> 01:37:40,560
no gun found said Betty as for the

2470
01:37:40,560 --> 01:37:42,840
bullet as far as I know it's still at

2471
01:37:42,840 --> 01:37:45,300
the end of a short tunnel into his skull

2472
01:37:45,300 --> 01:37:48,179
and the horse oh I don't think we can

2473
01:37:48,179 --> 01:37:50,580
pin it on the horse sir the policeman

2474
01:37:50,580 --> 01:37:52,920
said with a smirk

2475
01:37:52,920 --> 01:37:55,800
Sergeant Berry Holmes was threateningly

2476
01:37:55,800 --> 01:37:58,080
patient are you able to assist me in

2477
01:37:58,080 --> 01:37:59,940
this investigation or would it be more

2478
01:37:59,940 --> 01:38:02,040
convenient to you if I were to apply to

2479
01:38:02,040 --> 01:38:04,380
my acquaintances at the yard to find me

2480
01:38:04,380 --> 01:38:07,139
an alternative guide

2481
01:38:07,139 --> 01:38:10,139
the policeman looked suddenly chastened

2482
01:38:10,139 --> 01:38:13,980
just my joke Mr Holmes yes I can take

2483
01:38:13,980 --> 01:38:15,659
you to the horse sir

2484
01:38:15,659 --> 01:38:18,360
and to the body

2485
01:38:18,360 --> 01:38:21,060
we saw the horse first it had been

2486
01:38:21,060 --> 01:38:22,800
stabled with the police horses in a yard

2487
01:38:22,800 --> 01:38:25,260
in the village a tall brown stallion

2488
01:38:25,260 --> 01:38:27,659
with rather frightened eyes when young

2489
01:38:27,659 --> 01:38:29,940
it must have been a formidable creature

2490
01:38:29,940 --> 01:38:32,760
now it looked ragged from a lifetime of

2491
01:38:32,760 --> 01:38:35,460
hard riding Holmes looked it over

2492
01:38:35,460 --> 01:38:37,860
carefully the animal was skittish

2493
01:38:37,860 --> 01:38:40,139
seemingly distressed and tried to pull

2494
01:38:40,139 --> 01:38:42,300
away when Holmes held its Bridle to

2495
01:38:42,300 --> 01:38:44,040
examine its head

2496
01:38:44,040 --> 01:38:46,139
I watched rather nervously as my friend

2497
01:38:46,139 --> 01:38:47,820
entered the stable Bay and walked around

2498
01:38:47,820 --> 01:38:49,500
the animal which threatened to jostle

2499
01:38:49,500 --> 01:38:51,120
him against the walls

2500
01:38:51,120 --> 01:38:53,580
then when he reached the front of the

2501
01:38:53,580 --> 01:38:55,560
creature again home said

2502
01:38:55,560 --> 01:38:58,260
there's a Mark here a sharp wound can

2503
01:38:58,260 --> 01:38:59,699
you see

2504
01:38:59,699 --> 01:39:01,980
on the right foreleg just above the

2505
01:39:01,980 --> 01:39:04,739
fetlock joint was a slender but quite

2506
01:39:04,739 --> 01:39:07,620
noticeable lesion apparently caused

2507
01:39:07,620 --> 01:39:09,179
fairly recently

2508
01:39:09,179 --> 01:39:11,880
Holmes turned to Betty again

2509
01:39:11,880 --> 01:39:13,560
was this Mark here when the horse was

2510
01:39:13,560 --> 01:39:16,139
found I believe so

2511
01:39:16,139 --> 01:39:18,780
good well since we seem to be in the

2512
01:39:18,780 --> 01:39:20,219
business of investigating wounds today

2513
01:39:20,219 --> 01:39:21,540
you'd better show us the way to the

2514
01:39:21,540 --> 01:39:24,360
morgue incidentally Sergeant how well do

2515
01:39:24,360 --> 01:39:26,639
you know the accused man

2516
01:39:26,639 --> 01:39:29,699
fairly well replied the policeman

2517
01:39:29,699 --> 01:39:31,020
do you know whether he has friends

2518
01:39:31,020 --> 01:39:34,020
acquaintances perhaps of some intimacy

2519
01:39:34,020 --> 01:39:37,080
well not really that I know of so

2520
01:39:37,080 --> 01:39:38,760
it was always at his father's public

2521
01:39:38,760 --> 01:39:41,460
house and they were ever a close lot I

2522
01:39:41,460 --> 01:39:44,400
mean the sergeant Betty stopped he

2523
01:39:44,400 --> 01:39:46,199
became instantly animated and

2524
01:39:46,199 --> 01:39:49,139
business-like a gleam came into his eyes

2525
01:39:49,139 --> 01:39:51,780
and he said look there's the military

2526
01:39:51,780 --> 01:39:53,940
missed Rome's just after the church I'll

2527
01:39:53,940 --> 01:39:55,860
leave you to it if I may just thought of

2528
01:39:55,860 --> 01:39:57,659
something rather urgent I've got to do

2529
01:39:57,659 --> 01:40:00,900
and very briskly almost running he

2530
01:40:00,900 --> 01:40:04,159
disappeared back towards the village

2531
01:40:04,159 --> 01:40:07,380
strange I said to Holmes what do you

2532
01:40:07,380 --> 01:40:08,760
think that was about

2533
01:40:08,760 --> 01:40:11,940
I think said Holmes that I've put an

2534
01:40:11,940 --> 01:40:14,940
idea into his head I only hope it

2535
01:40:14,940 --> 01:40:17,460
doesn't complicate matters

2536
01:40:17,460 --> 01:40:20,040
it transpired that a postmortem on the

2537
01:40:20,040 --> 01:40:22,199
dead man had been commissioned but that

2538
01:40:22,199 --> 01:40:24,360
the police pathologist had only arrived

2539
01:40:24,360 --> 01:40:26,880
from London that morning possibly on the

2540
01:40:26,880 --> 01:40:29,040
same train as Holmes and myself

2541
01:40:29,040 --> 01:40:31,440
I knew Professor Yardley a little

2542
01:40:31,440 --> 01:40:33,060
through my connection with Saint Mary's

2543
01:40:33,060 --> 01:40:35,219
Hospital in Paddington and he was quite

2544
01:40:35,219 --> 01:40:36,900
amenable to my assisting him with the

2545
01:40:36,900 --> 01:40:38,280
matter in hand

2546
01:40:38,280 --> 01:40:40,679
he was a conscientious practitioner and

2547
01:40:40,679 --> 01:40:42,480
while the cause of death seemed evident

2548
01:40:42,480 --> 01:40:44,460
he thoroughly inspected the

2549
01:40:44,460 --> 01:40:46,080
externalities of the corpse before

2550
01:40:46,080 --> 01:40:48,900
opening it the head wound was a clean

2551
01:40:48,900 --> 01:40:51,719
almost star-shaped hole glutted with

2552
01:40:51,719 --> 01:40:53,159
dried blood

2553
01:40:53,159 --> 01:40:54,840
there was no wound on the back of the

2554
01:40:54,840 --> 01:40:57,239
head and it was apparent that the bullet

2555
01:40:57,239 --> 01:41:00,260
had not exited the body

2556
01:41:00,260 --> 01:41:02,159
notwithstanding that there was no weapon

2557
01:41:02,159 --> 01:41:04,980
at the scene Holmes said suicide seems

2558
01:41:04,980 --> 01:41:06,300
out of the question wouldn't you say

2559
01:41:06,300 --> 01:41:08,280
that a no Powder Burns to the skin and

2560
01:41:08,280 --> 01:41:10,199
besides the wound is probably too small

2561
01:41:10,199 --> 01:41:11,699
for a close shot

2562
01:41:11,699 --> 01:41:13,440
I'd say the missile came from some

2563
01:41:13,440 --> 01:41:14,580
distance

2564
01:41:14,580 --> 01:41:16,980
the bullet had it turned out penetrated

2565
01:41:16,980 --> 01:41:18,900
the brow and lodged deep in the parietal

2566
01:41:18,900 --> 01:41:21,420
lobe of the brain but as Holmes had

2567
01:41:21,420 --> 01:41:23,400
suggested the hole in the skull was

2568
01:41:23,400 --> 01:41:25,500
small and there was not the dramatic

2569
01:41:25,500 --> 01:41:27,120
shattering of bone one might have

2570
01:41:27,120 --> 01:41:29,940
expected from a close shot suicide

2571
01:41:29,940 --> 01:41:32,340
Professor Yardley concurred was not a

2572
01:41:32,340 --> 01:41:33,480
possibility

2573
01:41:33,480 --> 01:41:35,520
we are certainly looking for a murderer

2574
01:41:35,520 --> 01:41:37,320
then I commented to Holmes as we

2575
01:41:37,320 --> 01:41:39,780
wandered back towards stovey well

2576
01:41:39,780 --> 01:41:42,119
somebody killed Henry weeks for certain

2577
01:41:42,119 --> 01:41:44,940
Watson but I have to confess that at

2578
01:41:44,940 --> 01:41:47,699
this moment I have no idea who it was

2579
01:41:47,699 --> 01:41:49,800
you didn't think we might be wrong about

2580
01:41:49,800 --> 01:41:52,080
Jack Carpenter after all

2581
01:41:52,080 --> 01:41:54,900
I do hope not Watson it would be an

2582
01:41:54,900 --> 01:41:57,600
appalling tragedy but then I suppose for

2583
01:41:57,600 --> 01:41:59,760
one poor soul or another murder always

2584
01:41:59,760 --> 01:42:02,119
is

2585
01:42:02,639 --> 01:42:05,280
hoped that our next Port of Call would

2586
01:42:05,280 --> 01:42:07,560
be the horse in colors for an icy wind

2587
01:42:07,560 --> 01:42:09,480
had blown up and I was ready for a glass

2588
01:42:09,480 --> 01:42:11,880
of beer and the comfort of the Inns

2589
01:42:11,880 --> 01:42:13,440
blazing logs

2590
01:42:13,440 --> 01:42:15,840
but Holmes walked us straight to stovey

2591
01:42:15,840 --> 01:42:17,760
station where he said we must make an

2592
01:42:17,760 --> 01:42:20,400
important call I stealed myself against

2593
01:42:20,400 --> 01:42:22,500
the increasing cold as the last Light

2594
01:42:22,500 --> 01:42:25,320
feeded from the sky

2595
01:42:25,320 --> 01:42:28,020
the station Master at stovey was Milton

2596
01:42:28,020 --> 01:42:30,239
Fraser a man dressed to give the

2597
01:42:30,239 --> 01:42:33,060
impression of order and precision his

2598
01:42:33,060 --> 01:42:35,219
cap fitting perfectly the balding sphere

2599
01:42:35,219 --> 01:42:37,800
of a small neat head and a fine silver

2600
01:42:37,800 --> 01:42:40,139
pocket watch peeping from his waistcoat

2601
01:42:40,139 --> 01:42:43,020
pocket Holmes whose own knowledge of the

2602
01:42:43,020 --> 01:42:45,719
country's Railways is second to none one

2603
01:42:45,719 --> 01:42:48,119
his confidence easily

2604
01:42:48,119 --> 01:42:50,580
I wish to ask you Mr Fraser he said

2605
01:42:50,580 --> 01:42:53,280
about yesterday evening there is a late

2606
01:42:53,280 --> 01:42:55,139
train to London I believe

2607
01:42:55,139 --> 01:43:00,360
the 1059 sir it was on time it was as it

2608
01:43:00,360 --> 01:43:02,040
generally is not much traffic on the

2609
01:43:02,040 --> 01:43:03,480
tracks at that hour

2610
01:43:03,480 --> 01:43:05,460
and do you recall whether any passengers

2611
01:43:05,460 --> 01:43:08,340
boarded the train at stovy course Adusa

2612
01:43:08,340 --> 01:43:10,440
Young Jack Carpenter

2613
01:43:10,440 --> 01:43:13,320
just him yes sir his father saw him

2614
01:43:13,320 --> 01:43:15,000
aboard I watched the train pull away

2615
01:43:15,000 --> 01:43:17,159
myself and there is no way anyone could

2616
01:43:17,159 --> 01:43:19,320
have left the train after that while not

2617
01:43:19,320 --> 01:43:20,880
here in the station no not without my

2618
01:43:20,880 --> 01:43:24,480
seeing him not in the station no

2619
01:43:24,480 --> 01:43:26,280
I suppose it might be possible for

2620
01:43:26,280 --> 01:43:28,260
someone to alight at the Crossing the

2621
01:43:28,260 --> 01:43:29,520
level crossing

2622
01:43:29,520 --> 01:43:31,980
yes sir the 1059 always stops a dark

2623
01:43:31,980 --> 01:43:33,900
Hill Crossing for a few minutes safety

2624
01:43:33,900 --> 01:43:35,880
precautions are Thornley bridge over the

2625
01:43:35,880 --> 01:43:37,739
star is considered unsafe for two trains

2626
01:43:37,739 --> 01:43:39,360
until they finish the repairs so the

2627
01:43:39,360 --> 01:43:41,940
1059 uptrend must wait until the 1104

2628
01:43:41,940 --> 01:43:43,500
down has come through

2629
01:43:43,500 --> 01:43:45,960
and this happens every night can't

2630
01:43:45,960 --> 01:43:47,540
recollect when it lasts didn't sir

2631
01:43:47,540 --> 01:43:50,400
lastly Mr Fraser can you recall which

2632
01:43:50,400 --> 01:43:52,199
part of the train Mr Carpenter boarded

2633
01:43:52,199 --> 01:43:53,639
second compartment of the third

2634
01:43:53,639 --> 01:43:55,739
character I'm quite sure of that

2635
01:43:55,739 --> 01:43:58,020
thank you Mr Fraser you've been more

2636
01:43:58,020 --> 01:44:00,980
helpful than you know

2637
01:44:01,020 --> 01:44:04,260
I suppose we now have to consider I said

2638
01:44:04,260 --> 01:44:06,060
to my companion back at the horse in

2639
01:44:06,060 --> 01:44:08,460
colors as I stared into the Flames of

2640
01:44:08,460 --> 01:44:09,360
the fire

2641
01:44:09,360 --> 01:44:12,900
the Jack Carpenter shot Henry weeks from

2642
01:44:12,900 --> 01:44:15,420
the stationary train we must considered

2643
01:44:15,420 --> 01:44:17,520
it certainly yet I think it rather

2644
01:44:17,520 --> 01:44:18,840
unlikely

2645
01:44:18,840 --> 01:44:20,460
how would Carpenter have known his

2646
01:44:20,460 --> 01:44:21,960
intended target was going to be waiting

2647
01:44:21,960 --> 01:44:23,580
there at the Crossing

2648
01:44:23,580 --> 01:44:25,920
then what is the significance of the

2649
01:44:25,920 --> 01:44:27,960
stopping train has it any

2650
01:44:27,960 --> 01:44:30,360
I'm beginning to think it has but I must

2651
01:44:30,360 --> 01:44:32,400
confess to being currently unsure in

2652
01:44:32,400 --> 01:44:33,840
what way

2653
01:44:33,840 --> 01:44:35,100
well

2654
01:44:35,100 --> 01:44:38,040
let's eat and then sleep on it I said

2655
01:44:38,040 --> 01:44:41,100
but at that moment our cozy evening was

2656
01:44:41,100 --> 01:44:44,040
horribly interrupted a young woman hair

2657
01:44:44,040 --> 01:44:46,139
disheveled came screaming into the bar

2658
01:44:46,139 --> 01:44:50,040
Mr Carpenter Mr Carpenter the elderly

2659
01:44:50,040 --> 01:44:51,780
landlord came rushing in from the

2660
01:44:51,780 --> 01:44:54,600
kitchen what is it Sarah it's Beth

2661
01:44:54,600 --> 01:44:57,540
Miller they've taken her in her who's

2662
01:44:57,540 --> 01:45:00,000
taken her the police that Sergeant

2663
01:45:00,000 --> 01:45:02,520
berries arrested her says he found a gun

2664
01:45:02,520 --> 01:45:05,159
what's this Pride homes who is Beth

2665
01:45:05,159 --> 01:45:06,000
Miller

2666
01:45:06,000 --> 01:45:09,960
Beth is my son Jax betrothed Carpenter

2667
01:45:09,960 --> 01:45:11,820
said their wedding is fixed for next

2668
01:45:11,820 --> 01:45:12,840
month

2669
01:45:12,840 --> 01:45:15,480
Beth's a good and honest young woman and

2670
01:45:15,480 --> 01:45:18,540
gentler as a lamb I'll see that blasted

2671
01:45:18,540 --> 01:45:21,300
policeman Holmes barred his way and put

2672
01:45:21,300 --> 01:45:23,400
a hand on his shoulder if I'm to help

2673
01:45:23,400 --> 01:45:25,500
you Mr Carpenter he said staring hard

2674
01:45:25,500 --> 01:45:28,020
into the man's wild eyes believe me when

2675
01:45:28,020 --> 01:45:29,280
I say that it will not serve our

2676
01:45:29,280 --> 01:45:31,679
purposes to be too precipitous Dr Watson

2677
01:45:31,679 --> 01:45:32,940
and I will go straight to the police

2678
01:45:32,940 --> 01:45:34,980
station and find out what's happening I

2679
01:45:34,980 --> 01:45:36,600
beg of you to do nothing before you hear

2680
01:45:36,600 --> 01:45:38,880
from us

2681
01:45:38,880 --> 01:45:41,100
having received Carpenter's assurances

2682
01:45:41,100 --> 01:45:43,440
we made our way out of stovey to the

2683
01:45:43,440 --> 01:45:45,600
police station a thick walled Stone

2684
01:45:45,600 --> 01:45:47,460
building halfway along to the next

2685
01:45:47,460 --> 01:45:50,880
Village once a brewery it now had the

2686
01:45:50,880 --> 01:45:53,820
Grim air of a medieval lock-up it would

2687
01:45:53,820 --> 01:45:55,619
not be exaggerating to say that my

2688
01:45:55,619 --> 01:45:57,420
friend and I received a cool welcome

2689
01:45:57,420 --> 01:46:00,179
from Sergeant Betty whose domain this

2690
01:46:00,179 --> 01:46:02,100
appeared to be

2691
01:46:02,100 --> 01:46:04,920
yes sir I do have a young woman in

2692
01:46:04,920 --> 01:46:07,139
custody here and I can confirm that she

2693
01:46:07,139 --> 01:46:10,199
has been charged on suspicion of murder

2694
01:46:10,199 --> 01:46:13,380
and can you tell me said Holmes how she

2695
01:46:13,380 --> 01:46:15,659
is supposed to have committed this crime

2696
01:46:15,659 --> 01:46:18,000
well obviously sir we don't know all the

2697
01:46:18,000 --> 01:46:19,500
details yet but with a bit of

2698
01:46:19,500 --> 01:46:22,020
imagination an intelligent person might

2699
01:46:22,020 --> 01:46:24,300
construe that she had lured Mr weeks to

2700
01:46:24,300 --> 01:46:27,800
Nightingale Lane on some shall we say

2701
01:46:27,800 --> 01:46:30,659
enticing pretext Lane and wait for him

2702
01:46:30,659 --> 01:46:33,000
and dispatched him with the bullet as he

2703
01:46:33,000 --> 01:46:37,080
tethered his horse and said Holmes would

2704
01:46:37,080 --> 01:46:39,900
this same intelligent person construe

2705
01:46:39,900 --> 01:46:42,719
that Jack Carpenter had a part in this

2706
01:46:42,719 --> 01:46:46,619
well yes sir that person assuming he was

2707
01:46:46,619 --> 01:46:49,440
using his faculties would conclude that

2708
01:46:49,440 --> 01:46:51,540
quite obviously Jack Carpenter was an

2709
01:46:51,540 --> 01:46:54,179
accessory before the fact and therefore

2710
01:46:54,179 --> 01:46:56,280
equally culpable

2711
01:46:56,280 --> 01:46:59,340
thank you Sergeant Holmes said for

2712
01:46:59,340 --> 01:47:01,679
simplifying what I in my sluggishness of

2713
01:47:01,679 --> 01:47:05,280
Mind had considered a mystifying problem

2714
01:47:05,280 --> 01:47:07,440
might it be possible for us to see the

2715
01:47:07,440 --> 01:47:10,739
prisoner now I'm sorry sir I couldn't

2716
01:47:10,739 --> 01:47:13,860
permit that or should it wait until I

2717
01:47:13,860 --> 01:47:15,719
have received Authority from my good

2718
01:47:15,719 --> 01:47:18,560
friend superintendent whales at the yard

2719
01:47:18,560 --> 01:47:21,960
the policeman licked his lips pretended

2720
01:47:21,960 --> 01:47:24,179
to consult a piece of paper on his desk

2721
01:47:24,179 --> 01:47:25,860
and said

2722
01:47:25,860 --> 01:47:28,920
well as you say you are or a friend of

2723
01:47:28,920 --> 01:47:31,800
the superintendent sir I'm sure five

2724
01:47:31,800 --> 01:47:33,900
minutes wouldn't hurt

2725
01:47:33,900 --> 01:47:36,300
we were shown to a cavernous room where

2726
01:47:36,300 --> 01:47:38,219
rusted iron remnants of the Brew House

2727
01:47:38,219 --> 01:47:41,280
remained bolted to the walls and ceiling

2728
01:47:41,280 --> 01:47:44,100
a large Skylight had been set with bars

2729
01:47:44,100 --> 01:47:46,199
and there were no other windows

2730
01:47:46,199 --> 01:47:48,719
a pretty dark-haired girl of no more

2731
01:47:48,719 --> 01:47:51,960
than 20 years sat at a wooden table

2732
01:47:51,960 --> 01:47:54,179
she reacted to us with suspicion as we

2733
01:47:54,179 --> 01:47:56,280
were admitted but no sooner had the

2734
01:47:56,280 --> 01:47:58,500
Constable left us alone with her and no

2735
01:47:58,500 --> 01:48:00,780
doubt largely in desperation she

2736
01:48:00,780 --> 01:48:03,840
confided in US readily

2737
01:48:03,840 --> 01:48:05,639
Miss Miller we have a limited amount of

2738
01:48:05,639 --> 01:48:07,920
time Holmes said to her and you must

2739
01:48:07,920 --> 01:48:09,719
tell us everything you can about this

2740
01:48:09,719 --> 01:48:13,440
business yes sir I'll try I think I may

2741
01:48:13,440 --> 01:48:15,719
have done something foolish sir

2742
01:48:15,719 --> 01:48:18,900
foolish I think I were the first to find

2743
01:48:18,900 --> 01:48:21,780
the body sir you see well now said

2744
01:48:21,780 --> 01:48:22,860
Holmes

2745
01:48:22,860 --> 01:48:25,739
I had certainly not guessed that I plan

2746
01:48:25,739 --> 01:48:27,900
to see my Jack onto the London train she

2747
01:48:27,900 --> 01:48:29,880
continued but we was held back at the

2748
01:48:29,880 --> 01:48:31,619
farm delivering a calf and I knew I was

2749
01:48:31,619 --> 01:48:33,900
likely to miss him the train usually

2750
01:48:33,900 --> 01:48:36,179
stops by dark heel Crossing so I thought

2751
01:48:36,179 --> 01:48:38,820
if I cut a long Nightingale Lane I might

2752
01:48:38,820 --> 01:48:40,440
be able to wave him off

2753
01:48:40,440 --> 01:48:42,300
but when I got there the train was

2754
01:48:42,300 --> 01:48:44,580
already disappearing across the bridge

2755
01:48:44,580 --> 01:48:45,900
then

2756
01:48:45,900 --> 01:48:49,380
a stone strobe from the track I saw a

2757
01:48:49,380 --> 01:48:52,199
horse tied up to the fence and something

2758
01:48:52,199 --> 01:48:54,480
on the road beside it

2759
01:48:54,480 --> 01:48:56,960
when I got up close I saw who it was

2760
01:48:56,960 --> 01:49:01,139
Henry weeks covered in blood and next to

2761
01:49:01,139 --> 01:49:05,219
him the gun and you picked up the gun I

2762
01:49:05,219 --> 01:49:08,699
asked yes sir why why did you not go

2763
01:49:08,699 --> 01:49:11,159
directly to the police well sir because

2764
01:49:11,159 --> 01:49:14,219
I recognized the gun I meant to hide it

2765
01:49:14,219 --> 01:49:15,119
somewhere

2766
01:49:15,119 --> 01:49:17,880
it were Jack's gun you see

2767
01:49:17,880 --> 01:49:20,600
I failed to conceal my shock

2768
01:49:20,600 --> 01:49:22,980
Jack's gun

2769
01:49:22,980 --> 01:49:25,800
so you took the gun home said because

2770
01:49:25,800 --> 01:49:27,659
you thought Jack Carpenter might have

2771
01:49:27,659 --> 01:49:30,060
killed weeks yes sir

2772
01:49:30,060 --> 01:49:33,420
that was my fear even though Jack was on

2773
01:49:33,420 --> 01:49:34,619
the train

2774
01:49:34,619 --> 01:49:36,719
I didn't know how long week said Lane

2775
01:49:36,719 --> 01:49:38,280
there sir to

2776
01:49:38,280 --> 01:49:40,080
it's a lonely place and he might have

2777
01:49:40,080 --> 01:49:41,580
been there for hours

2778
01:49:41,580 --> 01:49:43,020
so that didn't look good for Jack

2779
01:49:43,020 --> 01:49:44,760
departing as he did the very same

2780
01:49:44,760 --> 01:49:46,080
evening

2781
01:49:46,080 --> 01:49:48,199
I weren't sure of nothing Mr rhones

2782
01:49:48,199 --> 01:49:50,639
except that Jack was likely to get the

2783
01:49:50,639 --> 01:49:52,619
blame everyone knowing about the Venom

2784
01:49:52,619 --> 01:49:54,659
between him and the Week's family

2785
01:49:54,659 --> 01:49:57,719
and what home said did you do with

2786
01:49:57,719 --> 01:50:01,199
Jack's gun wrapped it in Marshall slung

2787
01:50:01,199 --> 01:50:02,760
it on my shoulder and took it home to

2788
01:50:02,760 --> 01:50:03,900
hide it

2789
01:50:03,900 --> 01:50:06,780
but I was unlucky on the way I passed

2790
01:50:06,780 --> 01:50:08,699
Sergeant Berry uh I think he must

2791
01:50:08,699 --> 01:50:11,159
afterwards have puzzled over my strange

2792
01:50:11,159 --> 01:50:13,800
burden for he came today to search the

2793
01:50:13,800 --> 01:50:16,500
cottage and that's when I was arrested

2794
01:50:16,500 --> 01:50:19,800
hopes I said if the murder weapon was

2795
01:50:19,800 --> 01:50:22,139
beside the body doesn't that at least

2796
01:50:22,139 --> 01:50:25,260
establish Jack's innocence unfortunately

2797
01:50:25,260 --> 01:50:27,600
not Watson the Assumption we had made

2798
01:50:27,600 --> 01:50:29,760
was that the murder occurred while Jack

2799
01:50:29,760 --> 01:50:31,980
was on the train if it happened well

2800
01:50:31,980 --> 01:50:34,320
before that I fear that either he or

2801
01:50:34,320 --> 01:50:36,060
Miss Miller here remained the primer

2802
01:50:36,060 --> 01:50:39,360
Facey Suspects but I didn't kill Henry

2803
01:50:39,360 --> 01:50:42,179
weeks sir I I swear to God I don't

2804
01:50:42,179 --> 01:50:44,340
believe you did Miss Miller but we have

2805
01:50:44,340 --> 01:50:46,619
to convince the police of that

2806
01:50:46,619 --> 01:50:48,900
be hopeful

2807
01:50:48,900 --> 01:50:50,880
but as we walked back along the lane

2808
01:50:50,880 --> 01:50:52,800
that evening towards stovey in the horse

2809
01:50:52,800 --> 01:50:56,159
in colors Holmes seemed somewhat less

2810
01:50:56,159 --> 01:50:58,500
certain I have little to go on at this

2811
01:50:58,500 --> 01:51:01,139
moment except Instinct Watson I do not

2812
01:51:01,139 --> 01:51:03,239
feel that Jack Carpenter killed Henry

2813
01:51:03,239 --> 01:51:06,060
weeks and I feel even more strongly that

2814
01:51:06,060 --> 01:51:08,159
that young woman did not do it either

2815
01:51:08,159 --> 01:51:10,560
but feelings I'm afraid are not evidence

2816
01:51:10,560 --> 01:51:12,600
let's hurry back to the end and hope the

2817
01:51:12,600 --> 01:51:14,699
bar is still available to us then we can

2818
01:51:14,699 --> 01:51:16,380
make an assessment of these matters in

2819
01:51:16,380 --> 01:51:17,940
Comfort

2820
01:51:17,940 --> 01:51:20,100
the Inn was closed customers when we

2821
01:51:20,100 --> 01:51:22,560
arrived but Mr Carpenter hastily

2822
01:51:22,560 --> 01:51:24,600
provided us with a bottle of whiskey and

2823
01:51:24,600 --> 01:51:26,400
some bread and cheese

2824
01:51:26,400 --> 01:51:29,159
the fire was still glowing bright and I

2825
01:51:29,159 --> 01:51:31,020
sat there for a good hour while my

2826
01:51:31,020 --> 01:51:32,760
friend went away to ask some questions

2827
01:51:32,760 --> 01:51:34,619
of our host

2828
01:51:34,619 --> 01:51:37,739
eventually he returned and reclaimed his

2829
01:51:37,739 --> 01:51:40,080
seat beside the fire

2830
01:51:40,080 --> 01:51:42,239
can we number the suspects in this case

2831
01:51:42,239 --> 01:51:45,540
Watson well apart from Jack Carpenter

2832
01:51:45,540 --> 01:51:48,360
and the girl Beth Miller I said dropping

2833
01:51:48,360 --> 01:51:49,380
my voice

2834
01:51:49,380 --> 01:51:52,860
I suppose Jack's father our landlord is

2835
01:51:52,860 --> 01:51:54,480
another possibility

2836
01:51:54,480 --> 01:51:57,000
yes and since we know he saw jack off

2837
01:51:57,000 --> 01:51:58,800
onto the train either he or his son

2838
01:51:58,800 --> 01:52:00,239
would have needed to commit the murder

2839
01:52:00,239 --> 01:52:03,540
sometime earlier but how early

2840
01:52:03,540 --> 01:52:05,580
I've just spoken to him at length he

2841
01:52:05,580 --> 01:52:07,800
assures me and I believe him that there

2842
01:52:07,800 --> 01:52:09,600
are plenty of people prepared to swear

2843
01:52:09,600 --> 01:52:11,580
that both he and Jack were here all

2844
01:52:11,580 --> 01:52:13,920
afternoon and Beth spent the day at farm

2845
01:52:13,920 --> 01:52:15,060
work

2846
01:52:15,060 --> 01:52:16,440
even so

2847
01:52:16,440 --> 01:52:18,600
if the police go ahead and prosecute a

2848
01:52:18,600 --> 01:52:20,460
case against one or all of them there's

2849
01:52:20,460 --> 01:52:22,679
a strong chance a jury might find them

2850
01:52:22,679 --> 01:52:24,900
guilty based purely on the assumption

2851
01:52:24,900 --> 01:52:26,699
that they would at some time have had

2852
01:52:26,699 --> 01:52:28,139
the opportunity

2853
01:52:28,139 --> 01:52:31,260
we are not out of the woods yet Watson I

2854
01:52:31,260 --> 01:52:33,900
see what you mean our inquiries seem to

2855
01:52:33,900 --> 01:52:35,940
have stalled rather

2856
01:52:35,940 --> 01:52:38,280
I refilled our glasses from the whiskey

2857
01:52:38,280 --> 01:52:41,100
bottle and Holmes puffed at his pipe

2858
01:52:41,100 --> 01:52:44,219
then suddenly he said the secret is on

2859
01:52:44,219 --> 01:52:46,320
that train Watson I'm sure that's where

2860
01:52:46,320 --> 01:52:49,440
it is what time is it 20 minutes to 11.

2861
01:52:49,440 --> 01:52:51,239
come along we might just get there

2862
01:52:51,239 --> 01:52:53,820
before it leaves

2863
01:52:53,820 --> 01:52:56,520
it was an old cut that transported US

2864
01:52:56,520 --> 01:52:58,860
post heaths along the hold and muddy

2865
01:52:58,860 --> 01:53:01,080
Lanes of stovey so that we arrived at

2866
01:53:01,080 --> 01:53:02,820
the station splattered and not a little

2867
01:53:02,820 --> 01:53:05,580
shaken we were however in good time to

2868
01:53:05,580 --> 01:53:08,880
meet the 1059 unfortunately for us the

2869
01:53:08,880 --> 01:53:11,219
station Master Mr Milton Fraser was

2870
01:53:11,219 --> 01:53:13,800
again on duty despite his obvious

2871
01:53:13,800 --> 01:53:16,080
respect for my friend however he became

2872
01:53:16,080 --> 01:53:18,719
instantly resistant on hearing Holmes's

2873
01:53:18,719 --> 01:53:19,860
request

2874
01:53:19,860 --> 01:53:22,199
no sir I'm afraid I most definitely

2875
01:53:22,199 --> 01:53:25,500
cannot hold up the 1059 London train

2876
01:53:25,500 --> 01:53:29,100
Mr Fraser this is no flippant request an

2877
01:53:29,100 --> 01:53:30,780
innocent young woman will spend tonight

2878
01:53:30,780 --> 01:53:33,119
locked in a dungeon as will her fiance

2879
01:53:33,119 --> 01:53:35,219
unless I am able to complete certain

2880
01:53:35,219 --> 01:53:38,580
essential inquiries I ask only for 10

2881
01:53:38,580 --> 01:53:39,600
minutes

2882
01:53:39,600 --> 01:53:42,540
Mr romes my reputation may be a small

2883
01:53:42,540 --> 01:53:45,540
thing by the world's standards but it is

2884
01:53:45,540 --> 01:53:48,420
very important to me 10 minutes is a

2885
01:53:48,420 --> 01:53:50,520
long time to delay a train

2886
01:53:50,520 --> 01:53:52,619
but if I can guarantee you that this

2887
01:53:52,619 --> 01:53:55,080
will not affect your reputation can you

2888
01:53:55,080 --> 01:53:56,760
really do that sir

2889
01:53:56,760 --> 01:54:00,420
Mr Fraser you have my word on it

2890
01:54:00,420 --> 01:54:04,020
a long thoughtful pause then

2891
01:54:04,020 --> 01:54:06,300
very well Mr Holmes

2892
01:54:06,300 --> 01:54:09,420
I'll do as you ask

2893
01:54:09,420 --> 01:54:11,820
when two minutes later the great black

2894
01:54:11,820 --> 01:54:14,520
locomotive hauled its clanking carriages

2895
01:54:14,520 --> 01:54:17,460
into the station Mr Milton Fraser went

2896
01:54:17,460 --> 01:54:19,500
straight to the footplate and had words

2897
01:54:19,500 --> 01:54:21,600
with the engineer

2898
01:54:21,600 --> 01:54:23,940
a wave to Holmes and myself who were

2899
01:54:23,940 --> 01:54:26,699
some way along the platform told us all

2900
01:54:26,699 --> 01:54:29,699
was clear and we boarded the train

2901
01:54:29,699 --> 01:54:31,800
Holmes went directly to the second

2902
01:54:31,800 --> 01:54:34,380
compartment of the third Carriage which

2903
01:54:34,380 --> 01:54:37,080
contained just one late passenger an

2904
01:54:37,080 --> 01:54:38,940
elderly gentleman sitting beside what I

2905
01:54:38,940 --> 01:54:40,860
saw immediately to be the medical bag of

2906
01:54:40,860 --> 01:54:42,659
a general practitioner

2907
01:54:42,659 --> 01:54:44,760
if I may interrupt your peace and quiet

2908
01:54:44,760 --> 01:54:47,460
sir home said and having outlined his

2909
01:54:47,460 --> 01:54:50,280
reasons asked were you aboard this train

2910
01:54:50,280 --> 01:54:51,540
last night

2911
01:54:51,540 --> 01:54:55,440
I was said the older man I take this

2912
01:54:55,440 --> 01:54:57,480
train pretty well every night I'm a

2913
01:54:57,480 --> 01:54:59,280
medical man with a practice in Newbury

2914
01:54:59,280 --> 01:55:01,380
and a home in London

2915
01:55:01,380 --> 01:55:03,239
were you in this same compartment last

2916
01:55:03,239 --> 01:55:06,560
night the elderly physician laughed

2917
01:55:06,560 --> 01:55:09,659
creature of habit sir same compartment

2918
01:55:09,659 --> 01:55:11,340
every night

2919
01:55:11,340 --> 01:55:13,560
and do you recollect the young man who I

2920
01:55:13,560 --> 01:55:15,179
believe got onto the train at this

2921
01:55:15,179 --> 01:55:16,920
station yesterday

2922
01:55:16,920 --> 01:55:20,040
do is a matter of fact he sat there

2923
01:55:20,040 --> 01:55:22,320
right opposite me by the window

2924
01:55:22,320 --> 01:55:25,320
Pleasant young man good now sir the

2925
01:55:25,320 --> 01:55:27,239
train stopped at dark Hill crossing a

2926
01:55:27,239 --> 01:55:28,739
little way up the line do you recall

2927
01:55:28,739 --> 01:55:31,080
anything unusual about that

2928
01:55:31,080 --> 01:55:32,880
oh it stops there pretty well every

2929
01:55:32,880 --> 01:55:35,280
night but well

2930
01:55:35,280 --> 01:55:37,860
I do remember something as a matter of

2931
01:55:37,860 --> 01:55:38,760
fact

2932
01:55:38,760 --> 01:55:41,760
the train whistled as it usually does to

2933
01:55:41,760 --> 01:55:43,980
see if the downtrain is close enough to

2934
01:55:43,980 --> 01:55:45,060
respond

2935
01:55:45,060 --> 01:55:48,360
at just that moment I remarked a small

2936
01:55:48,360 --> 01:55:50,940
flash of light outside the train like

2937
01:55:50,940 --> 01:55:53,699
the sun reflecting off brass and the

2938
01:55:53,699 --> 01:55:55,920
young man said Holmes

2939
01:55:55,920 --> 01:55:57,960
what was his response

2940
01:55:57,960 --> 01:56:00,840
he seemed as puzzled as I was

2941
01:56:00,840 --> 01:56:02,400
he said he knew the area and couldn't

2942
01:56:02,400 --> 01:56:04,800
imagine what it could be thank you

2943
01:56:04,800 --> 01:56:07,440
doctor said Holmes he led me briskly

2944
01:56:07,440 --> 01:56:09,300
from the Train

2945
01:56:09,300 --> 01:56:11,100
we have just three of our 10 minutes

2946
01:56:11,100 --> 01:56:13,440
left before the train leaves Watson but

2947
01:56:13,440 --> 01:56:16,320
I think it might just be enough

2948
01:56:16,320 --> 01:56:18,780
Mr Fraser was waiting for us on the

2949
01:56:18,780 --> 01:56:19,800
platform

2950
01:56:19,800 --> 01:56:21,600
all done sir

2951
01:56:21,600 --> 01:56:25,199
at one final request Mr Fraser are these

2952
01:56:25,199 --> 01:56:27,780
the same carriages and in the same order

2953
01:56:27,780 --> 01:56:30,300
as made up the train last night

2954
01:56:30,300 --> 01:56:33,480
yes sir that doesn't change much

2955
01:56:33,480 --> 01:56:35,159
then I'll need to get onto the line to

2956
01:56:35,159 --> 01:56:37,080
check the other side of the train I

2957
01:56:37,080 --> 01:56:39,239
don't know Mr ohms the downtrain is due

2958
01:56:39,239 --> 01:56:41,580
you'll be at too much risk I shall be

2959
01:56:41,580 --> 01:56:43,860
quick and without further discussion he

2960
01:56:43,860 --> 01:56:45,480
re-entered the train crossed the

2961
01:56:45,480 --> 01:56:47,159
compartment opened the further door and

2962
01:56:47,159 --> 01:56:49,560
dropped onto the downline Beyond at

2963
01:56:49,560 --> 01:56:51,840
almost precisely that moment we heard a

2964
01:56:51,840 --> 01:56:54,239
whistle and Fraser said by golly Dr

2965
01:56:54,239 --> 01:56:56,460
Watson that's the downtrend crossing the

2966
01:56:56,460 --> 01:56:57,179
bridge

2967
01:56:57,179 --> 01:56:59,400
I waited for a half minute but when I

2968
01:56:59,400 --> 01:57:00,659
heard the rumble of the approaching

2969
01:57:00,659 --> 01:57:02,719
train I could restrain myself no longer

2970
01:57:02,719 --> 01:57:06,060
Holmes I called get a move on for God's

2971
01:57:06,060 --> 01:57:08,219
sake but the last words of my sentence

2972
01:57:08,219 --> 01:57:10,260
were drowned by the Roar of a locomotive

2973
01:57:10,260 --> 01:57:12,420
thundering into the station and hissing

2974
01:57:12,420 --> 01:57:16,199
to a halt next to the 10 59.

2975
01:57:16,199 --> 01:57:18,719
I'm not sure what I thought had happened

2976
01:57:18,719 --> 01:57:20,880
I could see that Holmes had not regained

2977
01:57:20,880 --> 01:57:22,739
the empty compartment for a terrible

2978
01:57:22,739 --> 01:57:26,639
moment I hovered in a cloud of anxiety

2979
01:57:26,639 --> 01:57:29,580
then his head appeared between the

2980
01:57:29,580 --> 01:57:31,920
bottom of the train and the platform

2981
01:57:31,920 --> 01:57:34,739
Edge he had ducked under the stationary

2982
01:57:34,739 --> 01:57:37,199
train to avoid the incoming Express

2983
01:57:37,199 --> 01:57:38,940
Homes

2984
01:57:38,940 --> 01:57:41,280
are you all right more than all right

2985
01:57:41,280 --> 01:57:44,460
Watson he said as he clambered back onto

2986
01:57:44,460 --> 01:57:45,540
the platform

2987
01:57:45,540 --> 01:57:48,179
especially as I believe I can now name

2988
01:57:48,179 --> 01:57:51,360
our murderer he turned to the rather

2989
01:57:51,360 --> 01:57:53,219
shaken station master

2990
01:57:53,219 --> 01:57:55,800
the train may leave Mr Fraser but there

2991
01:57:55,800 --> 01:57:57,960
are conditions I see there are no

2992
01:57:57,960 --> 01:57:59,940
facilities for uncoupling a carriage

2993
01:57:59,940 --> 01:58:01,560
here in stovey

2994
01:58:01,560 --> 01:58:04,320
correct sir there are no sightings here

2995
01:58:04,320 --> 01:58:06,719
then I must ask you to travel to London

2996
01:58:06,719 --> 01:58:08,820
with the train and to ensure on arrival

2997
01:58:08,820 --> 01:58:10,739
that the carriage in which the physician

2998
01:58:10,739 --> 01:58:13,199
gentleman is traveling is impounded at

2999
01:58:13,199 --> 01:58:14,520
Paddington

3000
01:58:14,520 --> 01:58:17,940
good Lord Mr ohms is the doctor a

3001
01:58:17,940 --> 01:58:19,020
suspect

3002
01:58:19,020 --> 01:58:22,739
no Mr Fraser but one might say the

3003
01:58:22,739 --> 01:58:25,520
carriage is

3004
01:58:25,560 --> 01:58:27,719
despite his misgivings the station

3005
01:58:27,719 --> 01:58:30,179
master was heroically compliant and

3006
01:58:30,179 --> 01:58:31,739
directly he had arranged for a message

3007
01:58:31,739 --> 01:58:34,199
to be sent to his own family he boarded

3008
01:58:34,199 --> 01:58:37,020
the 1059 which had now for one night

3009
01:58:37,020 --> 01:58:40,980
only become the 11 25 and the train

3010
01:58:40,980 --> 01:58:43,679
pulled out of the station on its way to

3011
01:58:43,679 --> 01:58:45,179
London

3012
01:58:45,179 --> 01:58:48,060
well Holmes I probably don't need to

3013
01:58:48,060 --> 01:58:51,540
tell you I said that I am completely

3014
01:58:51,540 --> 01:58:52,860
baffled

3015
01:58:52,860 --> 01:58:55,560
you can be forgiven for that Watson

3016
01:58:55,560 --> 01:58:58,199
it has been a puzzling business but you

3017
01:58:58,199 --> 01:59:00,360
do intend to explain to me how a trained

3018
01:59:00,360 --> 01:59:02,099
Carriage can be a suspect in a murder

3019
01:59:02,099 --> 01:59:04,260
case I will explain everything when we

3020
01:59:04,260 --> 01:59:06,060
get back to the horse in colors but

3021
01:59:06,060 --> 01:59:08,040
first I must ensure that Beth Miller is

3022
01:59:08,040 --> 01:59:10,199
released from that appalling prison and

3023
01:59:10,199 --> 01:59:13,320
spends tonight in her own bed

3024
01:59:13,320 --> 01:59:16,139
it was long past midnight when we sat

3025
01:59:16,139 --> 01:59:18,840
again in the comfort of the Inn

3026
01:59:18,840 --> 01:59:20,820
though I had not been present when

3027
01:59:20,820 --> 01:59:22,560
Holmes had put his theory before

3028
01:59:22,560 --> 01:59:25,739
Sergeant Berry at the makeshift jail he

3029
01:59:25,739 --> 01:59:27,540
had clearly made a convincing argument

3030
01:59:27,540 --> 01:59:29,880
because Beth Miller had been immediately

3031
01:59:29,880 --> 01:59:32,280
released and sat with us now at the

3032
01:59:32,280 --> 01:59:34,739
rough hewn table where Samuel Carpenter

3033
01:59:34,739 --> 01:59:37,619
bubbling with the turn in Fortune was

3034
01:59:37,619 --> 01:59:40,920
proving very liberal with his best ale

3035
01:59:40,920 --> 01:59:45,060
so who was it Mr ohms who was the

3036
01:59:45,060 --> 01:59:46,440
murderer

3037
01:59:46,440 --> 01:59:49,320
well that's not a simpler question to

3038
01:59:49,320 --> 01:59:51,360
answer as you might think said Holmes

3039
01:59:51,360 --> 01:59:54,239
the simple answer is that Henry weeks

3040
01:59:54,239 --> 01:59:56,639
was the murderer

3041
01:59:56,639 --> 01:59:59,880
do you mean it was suicide I said well

3042
01:59:59,880 --> 02:00:03,000
Watson whatever we call it that is no

3043
02:00:03,000 --> 02:00:05,219
doubt that when Henry weeks fired the

3044
02:00:05,219 --> 02:00:08,940
gun it was to Murder Jack Carpenter

3045
02:00:08,940 --> 02:00:11,699
around the table Mr Carpenter Beth

3046
02:00:11,699 --> 02:00:14,340
Miller and I all wearing similar baffled

3047
02:00:14,340 --> 02:00:17,179
Expressions sets staring at homes

3048
02:00:17,179 --> 02:00:20,280
waiting for him to elucidate

3049
02:00:20,280 --> 02:00:23,880
Henry weeks home said went to the spot

3050
02:00:23,880 --> 02:00:25,940
with the intention of killing Young Jack

3051
02:00:25,940 --> 02:00:28,380
he knew the train would stop there and

3052
02:00:28,380 --> 02:00:30,000
he meant to get a shot at his victim

3053
02:00:30,000 --> 02:00:31,679
through the carriage window

3054
02:00:31,679 --> 02:00:34,560
things seem to be going well for him

3055
02:00:34,560 --> 02:00:36,659
Jack Carpenter was sitting on the stovey

3056
02:00:36,659 --> 02:00:38,580
side of the train so weeks would have

3057
02:00:38,580 --> 02:00:40,739
had a good view of him from the lane

3058
02:00:40,739 --> 02:00:43,619
here is what I believe happened weeks

3059
02:00:43,619 --> 02:00:45,659
took aim but at the very moment he was

3060
02:00:45,659 --> 02:00:47,880
about to squeeze the trigger the train

3061
02:00:47,880 --> 02:00:49,980
blew its whistle

3062
02:00:49,980 --> 02:00:53,699
my guess is that the horse reared up and

3063
02:00:53,699 --> 02:00:56,580
kicked the butt of the gun hence that

3064
02:00:56,580 --> 02:00:59,460
wound on the beast's foreleg the gun

3065
02:00:59,460 --> 02:01:03,480
went off ah said I that flash of light

3066
02:01:03,480 --> 02:01:05,280
the physician on the train mentioned

3067
02:01:05,280 --> 02:01:08,099
precisely the sound of the shot was

3068
02:01:08,099 --> 02:01:09,900
probably drowned by the noise of the

3069
02:01:09,900 --> 02:01:13,020
Train the gun battle now tilted down its

3070
02:01:13,020 --> 02:01:15,540
aim sent low the bullet hit the wheel

3071
02:01:15,540 --> 02:01:18,000
bogey of the carriage the mark on the

3072
02:01:18,000 --> 02:01:19,800
metalwork is what I was so Keen to check

3073
02:01:19,800 --> 02:01:22,080
this evening and ricocheted back to

3074
02:01:22,080 --> 02:01:24,179
strike Henry weeks

3075
02:01:24,179 --> 02:01:28,320
so the train wheel was the killer I said

3076
02:01:28,320 --> 02:01:31,020
as I say one could impute the train or

3077
02:01:31,020 --> 02:01:32,520
the bullet or even the horse as

3078
02:01:32,520 --> 02:01:35,460
accessories for all were material in the

3079
02:01:35,460 --> 02:01:36,300
death

3080
02:01:36,300 --> 02:01:38,219
but the fact of the matter is that Henry

3081
02:01:38,219 --> 02:01:40,800
weeks in a rather elegant example of

3082
02:01:40,800 --> 02:01:43,980
poetic justice inadvertently murdered

3083
02:01:43,980 --> 02:01:46,520
himself

3084
02:01:46,580 --> 02:01:49,020
Holmes and I took the first train back

3085
02:01:49,020 --> 02:01:51,239
to London the following morning passing

3086
02:01:51,239 --> 02:01:53,760
on our way out of stovey station the

3087
02:01:53,760 --> 02:01:56,880
site of weeks's lonely death

3088
02:01:56,880 --> 02:02:00,179
put you onto it homes I asked

3089
02:02:00,179 --> 02:02:02,400
I suppose you could say Watson that

3090
02:02:02,400 --> 02:02:05,159
human goodness put me onto it not

3091
02:02:05,159 --> 02:02:07,139
deduction then

3092
02:02:07,139 --> 02:02:09,540
Samuel Carpenter his son jack Beth

3093
02:02:09,540 --> 02:02:12,719
Miller good people Watson

3094
02:02:12,719 --> 02:02:14,880
we were if my instinct about them was

3095
02:02:14,880 --> 02:02:17,400
correct distinctly short of homicidal

3096
02:02:17,400 --> 02:02:18,719
candidates

3097
02:02:18,719 --> 02:02:20,280
then you'll recollect the nature of

3098
02:02:20,280 --> 02:02:22,920
weeks's head wound clearly not suicide

3099
02:02:22,920 --> 02:02:24,960
as you noted yourself because of the

3100
02:02:24,960 --> 02:02:27,540
shallow nature of the wound but was it a

3101
02:02:27,540 --> 02:02:29,280
deep enough lesion to have been caused

3102
02:02:29,280 --> 02:02:31,619
by a direct hit at close range

3103
02:02:31,619 --> 02:02:33,719
that set me wondering about whether the

3104
02:02:33,719 --> 02:02:36,119
bullet might have rebounded

3105
02:02:36,119 --> 02:02:39,540
my examination of the train confirmed it

3106
02:02:39,540 --> 02:02:41,699
you're quite right about the wound

3107
02:02:41,699 --> 02:02:44,159
I dare say it didn't kill him outright

3108
02:02:44,159 --> 02:02:46,980
the poor man probably lay there for some

3109
02:02:46,980 --> 02:02:50,400
while bleeding to death in the cold well

3110
02:02:50,400 --> 02:02:54,239
said Holmes perhaps that Bleak hour may

3111
02:02:54,239 --> 02:02:56,400
have given him time to reconsider the

3112
02:02:56,400 --> 02:02:58,380
error of his ways

3113
02:02:58,380 --> 02:03:00,560
foreign

3114
02:03:02,599 --> 02:03:05,699
homes the rediscovered Railway Mysteries

3115
02:03:05,699 --> 02:03:08,219
and Other Stories was written by John

3116
02:03:08,219 --> 02:03:10,619
Taylor and read by Benedict Cumberbatch

3117
02:03:10,619 --> 02:03:13,500
